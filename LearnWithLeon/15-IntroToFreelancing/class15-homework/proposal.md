## OVERVIEW AND GOALS

Dear {client_contact_first},

It was great to speak with you yesterday about your new project for {client_name}. 

Gone are the days when we knew for certain that everyone was viewing the web on a desktop or laptop computer so websites were designed and developed for that standard experience.  Increasingly, people are viewing the web on a variety of devices - tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices. If your website doesn’t support those devices, this can negatively affect how users interact with your business. The site may load slowly, the layout is fixed and awkward to navigate and you may end up with a frustrated user. Statistics show that most users don’t convert when using small screen devices which means you may be losing out on valuable business opportunities.

I can turn this problem around using responsive design. I’ll redesign your website’s front-end templates to adapt and scale to whatever kind of device the user is viewing from while maintaining your existing look and feel and improving overall performance. I’ll test it on a variety of devices  - mobile and non-mobile - to ensure the experience is consistent and easy to use.

I want to improve your conversion by 50% for mobile users which, given the current percentage of users who visit websites on mobile devices currently, should impact sales by 20% per month. Now that’s what you’d call responsive, don’t you agree?

Sincerely,
&nbsp;

Jonah Thompson

## SCOPE OF SERVICES

### Research
The first step is I need to thoroughly understand your business, your business goals, your customers and their expectations and behaviour, and how your website factors into all of it. I’ll also look at the competitive landscape to establish context and benchmarks for how your site should function and then improve on that. This stage will give us the foundation for moving forward with just the right recommendations for the design and development of your new responsive website.

### Design
Once I'm armed with this information, I’ll set to work sketching out interface layouts for 3-5 different views, including the home page, sub page, the blog template, and any additional templates needed. Wireframes look like simple skeletons of your website without the visual polish of the finished design, allowing us to experiment and iterate on solutions quickly so that we have a good sense of how content should be laid out across different screen sizes.

Next I’ll design high-fidelity comps that show what the final designs will look like on desktop, tablet, and smart-phone screen sizes, providing up to two rounds of revisions on the design.

### Development
Once you’ve approved the design, I'll start building them using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. If you would like I can also create your designs with the React JavaScript framework which is a very popular modern framework.

## Hosting
After testing the static layouts, hosting of the site will need to be managed by you. I can recommend hosting providers and may be able to get the initial project setup for you if doing this. This will be listed as a seperate service in the estimate. After the website has been setup on this server any updates to or management of that server will be up to you.

## ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### User Testing

Although not required, testing the designs with real users will greatly improve the quality of the finished design and help catch usability issues before time is spent building out the designs. User testing involves our usability professionals recruiting up to 5 users and asking them to perform tasks. We record the results of the test and then deliver the video to you along with a list of usability issues or comments that our design team can implement. It’s like the digital version of the old adage “Measure twice, cut once.”

## Support Retainer

I recommend retaining our services after the site is launched to assist with any further support issues that arise. As part of this retainer we will also provide a set amount of time monthly in order to make changes or updates.
