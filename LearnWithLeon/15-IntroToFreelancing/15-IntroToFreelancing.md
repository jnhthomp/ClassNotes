## Just Ramblings Of Someone Who Has Done Some Of This Stuff Before
Leon is only speaking from his own experience and cannot give legal or tax advice

## USA Perspective
Most of this advice is going to be US based
Some of it may not apply if you are based in another country

## Why?
There are two major reason why freelancing is important
1. Money 
When Leon was in university he moved off campus and spent the summer working in labs
Eventually he ran out of money and didn't have money for food
He decided to just see if someone would pay him to build a website
Doing so taught him that he had a skill that would feed him for the rest of his life

2. Experience
All students leaving bootcamp are new engineers and hiring managers are wary of that
A lot of companies want to see previous work before spending the money to train/hire/recruit you
They will feel a lot better if they know you have worked for other people before
Getting your second or third job is waaay easier than getting your first
Freelancing allows employers to see that you were successfully able to create projects for other people


## How to play the game?
Up to you if you want to play...
Some people may not like some of the things covered because they cut corners
Some people may think that this is not the right way

At the end of the day you are provide value to your clients and they are happy

## Those that played...
A reading of those who have played...

In a survey of people that graduated
For people that landed a paid client their contracts were worth quite a bit (at least $200 per site)

## Questions? !ask
Questions will be answered at the end of the class
slido.com #833589

## What is freelancing?
Freelancing means working as an independent person or company rather than be employed by someone else
Instead of being employed by another company you provide value to a company or person while remaining independent

## Other Terms
Other ways freelancing is referred to:
- Self-employed
- Independent Contractor
- Contract (job, work, role)
- Consultant
- 1099

## W2 vs. 1099
In the US there are two different kinds of taxes (mainly)
People employed by a company receive a W2 form for taxes
An independent contactor will receive a 1099 form from a company showing how much money they gave you

When you are a freelancer the following apply

Not as great...
- No Taxes Withheld
- No Insurance
- No Work Extras
- No Retirement

Great!
- Own Boss? be your own boss
- Expenses? write them off

## PAY YO TAXES
Always pay your taxes or the IRS will get you
What most contractors do is put 30-40% of the money received from a job into a savings account 
This is used to pay taxes at the end of the year (or quarter if you do enough)

## Things it takes to get a client (discussed tonight)
1. Online Persona
2. Finding Clients
3. Proposal
4. Contract
5. Closing
6. Delivering 
7. Reinvesting / Building

## 1. Online Persona
## Portfolio, Twitter, Linkedin
These are the three things you need to establish in order to freelance
When people see these they think it needs to be intense or well thought out
They are actually simple you just have to do them correctly

It will take about 6 months for all of these social media things to "show up"
It is easies to use firstName lastName as their presence online
Some people try to start a business name and that is fine but it is easier to just use your name

## Portfolio Examples
Blaw ($1000):
https://barbaralaw.me
Blaw has landed $1000 contracts
They receive so many offers that they hand off clients to other 100Devs
Notice the profile here has a tag at the bottom that says "html5up"
That is because their profile is a template and it worked to get them huge contracts and a senior level position
 
Shawn (Amazon - $1495):
https://shawncharles.netlify.app
Another example of someone who has landed big contracts and a FAANG job 
Also used a template for their portfolio
It is also hosted on netflify
They don't even have their own domain and that is ok!

## Twitter

```

The way describe and talk about yourself is what people will believe about you

A lot of people still include "aspiring" or "junior" in their title
Nobody wants to hire that
You are a software engineer, say it

## Twitter
Sam (Material UI):

```

Has really good information on how to freelance and get clients

Portfolios and twitter are important because twitter ranks really high on google
It will help your other stuff rank higher

## Linkedin
Andy (Draft Kings):
https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-vasquez-dev/

One tip with linked and for listing previous experience is to list 3 things
1. What you did in the past
2. Your bootcamp experience. Not listed as a bootcamp we are in 100devs agency (training program)
3. What you are doing now (freelance experience)

For now we will keep our LinkedIn and twitter simple but will build them up

## If you need to use a template!
```js
let developer = true
let designer = false

if(designer === true){
  console.log("Design your portfolio")
}else{
  console.log("USE A TEMPLATE")
}
```

If you are a designer go ahead and design a portfolio
If you are not a designer then use a template

If you are not a designer and you get a client USE A TEMPLATE FOR THEM
Your job is to provide value to your client
They will appreciate the cost savings you provide to them by using a template
If they had to pay for a designer to design and then you build it that would cost more money
Should you tell them?
That is up to you
Some people are upfront and tell them and others do not
it depends on what the client is looking for, if they will care, or if they will know what you are talking about

## Templates
Free (and not shady af):
https://html5up.net
https://github.com/html5up-nsm-templates

After your first client: 
https://wrapbootstrap.com
https://themeforest.net

## Hosting
For free and easy hosting
netlify.com/drop

## Domains

Sometimes you can get the first year free
These are two popular registrars for domain names
1. Namecheap: Very helpful -Leon
2. IWantMyName: Sometimes namecheap won't have weird dot extensions and this has more options
OR

Just use netlify.app for free
You really don't need anything than this for yourself
Clients will want it on their own domain sometimes

DO NOT USE GODADDY
They are a terrible company with aweful support

## 2. Finding Clients
## Start Close
Let people close to you know
There is a good chance someone knows someone who needs a website
- Friends
- Family
- Social Media

## Go Local
Try freelancing with local companies first
It is a big advantage and people will want to hire you
- NETWORKING - tell everyone
  - At networking events say "Hi I'm name I build website for companies in x area"
  - Be Bob Vance and tell everyone what you do
- Local Listings 
  - (craigslist, fb marketplace, nextdoor etc. be careful tho) üö®‚ò†Ô∏è
- Places You Know
  - Places you go to like the local barber, nail salon, or restaurant
  - A lot of first clients are local businesses
- Outbound (pick a niche)

1. Pick a niche
  - what can you help people with? Who can you provide value? ex restuarants
2. Compile a list of every single of that type of business in your area
  - Do they have a website?
  - If they do is it shitty?
  - Reach out to them if either of the above are true
3. Keep a list of the businesses you are reaching out to and you may find someone
  - Call them and try to speak to a business owner
  - Try to get them to agree to a $100 dollar package (covered later)

## Outbound
Being local is still your biggest upsell

Build A List
Dial For Dollars
Examples?

## Go Wide
if you have too...

1. Gig Sites (upwork...fiverr...) üö®‚ò†Ô∏è
  - These are really hard because you are competing against a lot of people
  - To be successful you need to do 2 things
    - Invest heavily in presence on that gig site
    - Price everything really high
      - Sounds counter intuitive that everyone is trying to give the cheapest price
      - Never compete on price. Clients that are price sensitive are not who you want
      - People see the high price and think you provide value to justify that price
2. Forums (reddit...)
3. Build Authority
  - Pick a niche of website type that you can build really well
  - Build a bunch of them and people will see that you have made many of those kinds of sites
  - Hashnode is a free blog hosting site that can help you build authority

## 3. Proposal
Now we have found a client and started a conversation with that client
What are we doing for them?
What are we going to charge them?

## What is a proposal?
A simple walkthrough of what you are going to provide
You want to come to an agreement on what they need and what you can provide

## Proposal Examples
These are two good proposal templates
Both are free
- Proposify (Free): https://templates.proposify.com/proposal-template/responsive-web-design/609302
- Panda Doc (Free): https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pandadoc-prod-public-templates/sBANW87i68cHdvsjFyyEP7/template.pdf

Leon recommends combining proposify and panda doc together and take what you need from each
It breaks down what you will do and when you will do it

After your first client - upgrade
## Real Example
```
- I will do x and the client can have x number of edits

estimate:
logo design: $300
Final website development and QA: $700
Total: $1000
```
Give them a follow for agreeing to share:

## 4. Contracts
Contracts shouldn't be scary
They are there to protect both parties

## What is a contract?
## Protects Both Parties
Says What Happens When Something Goes Wrong
Everyone should always get a contract no matter who the client is

## Contract Example
This is a completely free contract you can use that has this stuff spelled out
- Stuff And Nonsense - Contract Killer (Free): https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer
  - On Github: https://gist.github.com/malarkey/4031110
  - This is a full breakdown of everything you need to put into your ocntract when working with a client
- Sam's "California / US" Modification: https://github.com/samuelsycamore/contract-killer
  - Contract killer is made by people in the UK
  - Sam went through and changed the wording so it would match what we say in the US
  - Recommend you use this!

After your first client - upgrade

## Important Bits
Make sure that the following is included in the contract!
THIS MUST BE IN EVERY CONTRACT
```
That said, we can‚Äôt guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can‚Äôt be liable to you or any third-party for damages, 
including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you‚Äôve advised us of them.
```
This says code may not be perfect and code may mess up occasionaly
This keeps it from being your problem

```
We‚Äôll own any intellectual property rights we‚Äôve developed prior to, 
or developed separately from this project and not paid for by you. 
We‚Äôll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a 
complete design and we‚Äôll license its use to you (ONCE PAID IN FULL), 
exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.
```
This means the project belongs to you forever
You are granting a license for them to use the project forever
This lets you use content or snippets from this for other projects or to display in a portfolio
They do not get this license until they have paid in full
Even if they see and play with it they cannot claim any rights to it until they pay you completely

It is always recommended to get a deposit using the following pattern
1. Get paid 50%
2. Do 50% of work
3. Get paid 25%
4. Do the next chunk
5. Get paid the last amount
6. Finish and transfer the project

Only work for work that has been paid for

## 5. How To Close
You have an online presence
You have talked to clients and send proposals
You have sent contracts

## The Magic Question
This is the most important question to ask a client
Ask about their project and take good notes
Listen and ask good questions

Then ask the important question after they have talked about everything they want
What is your ballpark budget?

When you have the budget say you could build a proposal around that budget
Then you can show how much you could build out

Don't answer any questions about hourly rate
an hourly rate punishes you for being good at your job
If you take more time they pay you more money
But you are going to do less time and get a better product but paid less

## When speaking with clients
- Be Firm
  - Don't let someone try to get you to take less money for more work
  - You will lose some clients but that is ok
  - If it is starting with trouble it will be trouble and end with trouble
Clear

Always!
Under Promise- the things that you can do
Over Deliver- exceed expectations with the final product

## When negotiating the proposal
Leave room to get help
TIME & MONEY

Take how long you think it will take and then double it at least
Always leave time and room in your budget for other engineers
You may even have to pay someone else to deliver a functionality

With higher paid clients you can be upfront and say you work with other people

## Get a deposit
Get some money up front may be less than 50% at first but should be built up to that

## 6. Deliver The Goods
Once it comes time to deliver the product
## Under Promise
## Over Deliver
## Communicate REGULARY ON A SCHEDUALE
If you communciate regularly you can get away with things like delays
Sometimes you can even ask for more money
Every friday send the client an email outlining what was done and where you will be going from there
It doesn't matter how much you got done
Do not leave them in the dark
This will keep you out of hot water since you have been upfront with them

## Get Help When Needed
Ask in 100Devs they may be able to help you if needed

## 7. Reinvest
All this will suck at first

## After First Clients:
if you have the privilege 

These are things you may need to do after the first few clients
- Better Portfolio
- Better Proposal
- Better Contract
- Business Entity 
- Lawyer
- CPA / Book Keeping

## Questions? !ask
How to handle hosting? 
Use Netlify. Make them setup their own account
Do it on your own account for testing and turn it over whenever they pay in full

How quickly should you make the proposal?
When you finish the conversation about the ballpark budget
When you get the budget ask if they have time to talk in the next 2 or 3 days
But send the proposal as soon as you can (within the day preferably)
The important part is to schedule the next call before hanging up
