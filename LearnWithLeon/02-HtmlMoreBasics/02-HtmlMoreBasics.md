## Trough Of Sorrow (Review)
Why does not everyone do it?
It takes a really long time
This is called the trough of sorrow (see slide pic): https://slides.com/leonnoel/100devs2-html-the-basics#/5

Leon says it can feel good to buy udemy courses but a lot of people don't finish them
I've found them very helpful myself

For a lot of people the novelty wears off and it takes a while through pursuing other means of education
Don't get too focused on getting a FAANG job - instead focus on getting A job
(Don't try to go straight to playing for the NFL - play some rec league first)

To make it through the trough of sorrow you will take about ~20 weeks of not feeling great and learning
Then some wiggles of soft hope
This is when you start getting responses for jobs and maybe even a few interviews
It is a good idea to apply to 60 companies
This doesn't mean just clicking apply this means networking with real people and talking with them
A few of them will go absolutely terrible and be absolutely bombed (10?)
Most will be alright (40?)
Then maybe 10 of them will go great 
Out of those ten maybe you will get 2 offers
Don't get discouraged and don't set your hopes too high

Right now it is about getting the tools we need to get to the point where we can apply
## Let Me Tell You A Secret
On Leon's github (https://github.com/leonnoel) there is a repository called "personal-learning-plan"
https://github.com/leonnoel/personal-learning-plan

If you do this then he will expect you to do the first part of free code course and then come back to him
Hardly anybody does or is able to take advantage of this option

To increase the success the two things that help are community and managing frustration

## Community (Review)
Discord: https://discord.com/invite/zNxhjnmDPy or leonnoel.com/discord if that discord invite expires
Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/learnwithleon
Twitter: https://twitter.com/leonnoel
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGiRSHBdWuCgjgmPPz_13xw

When you graduate and get a job the expectation is that you bring 3 more from the community with you
This means contributing to the community, answering questions, putting in time to help others
## Manage Frustration (Review)
IN THE CELEBRATION CHANNEL ON DISCORD THERE ARE 50 PEOPLE WHO GOT JOBS DUE TO THIS PROGRAM

Three key things that help people get through the trough of sorrow:
1. How to manage frustration
  There are two types of people that start to code
  One thinks that your ability to code is based on how smart you are
  It has to do with how much time you are willing to put in to learning
  
There was a famous study that came out that looked at when did people lose the ability to become fluent in a language
What they found out was that people don't lose this ability they just get older
When you get older you lose the ability to manage your frustration and discipline yourself
It is the concept that as you get older you are more in charge of your life
The mindset that successful students have are the ones that accept that they did not understand something
Instead of getting frustrated they put more time in and continue trying to learn it

2. Consistency
   Consistency is hands down the biggest factor in learning to code
   It is not about putting time in all day every day 
   It is about putting consistent time in consistently
   You don't need to do 10 hours a day you just need to be consistent every day
   
Class is about 6 hours a week (tuesday and thursday) 
Outside of class takes about 10 hours a week
The people that mess up are the ones that try to cram their studying/work into one big day
Instead of chunking huge hours that you won't be able to get just be consistent with a few hours a day

3. Ability to take care of yourself
   Most people burn out and lose motivation/endurance to keep going
   They start off putting too much in and get too tired
   Take care of yourself and pace yourself
   Be sure to eat right and excercise to keep your brain ready to learn
   Learning to code is a marathon not a sprint

## Make A Plan
If you want to commit to becoming a software engineer you need to have a plan
Think about how you are going to spend your time to ensure you get your studies done CONSISTENTLY

## Tell Someone
Tell someone that you are a software engineer and are commited to learning web development over 30 weeks
That way you have something to hold yourself accountable

## NOW TELL EVERYONE
Tell everyone so you hold yourself accountable
Sharing public what you are working on can help you succeed

## Active Recall (Review)
Today it is important to actively recall much more so than the previous lecture

Ali Abdaal: https://youtu.be/ukLnPbIffxE
Active recall is when you are reading something you intentionally recall the thing you just read
It is common to read through a chapter and kind of teleport to the end without thinking about what you are reading
You are taking in the information but you aren't really processing it

When you are learning something new stop every section (paragraph or chapter)
Then think about what you just read make sure you conceptualize and understand it

Leon says "Don't take notes, take questions"
As you are taking notes write something like:
"What is a study method I can use to do a quarter of the reading but have better memorization?"
Then at the end of the lecture look at your question

## Resetting Forgetting Curve (Review)
https://www.pearsoned.com/three-simple-research-based-ways-to-ace-a-test

The way to "reset" the forgetting curve is repetition
If we are to review material that we have forgotten our 60% memory retention goes from 3 days to 7 days
The more you repeat review it the more flat the forgetting curve gets

## What is the internet? (Review)
To be clear this is a 'jobs' program 
This will cover more than just coding
To make the lessons behind coding click properly learning to code isn't just learning to type in code
You also need to understand the technologies that run our code
We will be doing full stack web development so we need to understand the technologies behind the web

So what is the internet?
The internet is like a wire

On this wire there are two different kinds of computers
```
[client devices]-------------[servers]
```
Client devices are devices that consume content on the web
This includes phones, laptops, computers etc.

Servers are called such because they serve webpages, data, and content
They will provide html, css, js to client devices

This is done when a request comes from a client device and arrives at a server
The server hears this request and responds with... something

If the teacher asked you to open a word document you would probably use microsoft word to open it
If he gave you a pdf you would probably open it with adobe

The idea here is that we have programs that we can run on our devices to run certain files

On our computers we have a program called a browser (firefox, chrome, internet explorer etc)
These browsers are able to open and run html, css, and js files and display things based on those files

From our client devices we are using a program called a browser and making requests to a server
The server hears this request processes it and returns something

Think of it like a restaurant 
From your table you can make requests from the kitchen and the kitchen will send you food
You don't really care about what happens in the kitchen you just expect to receive the food

Our browsers are made to run the files that are sent back from

For an example lets pretend we will order from dominos
From the browser if we visit dominos.com the request will leave the phone and browser and make it all the way to the dominos server
Then the server will respond with html, css, and js files (these are individual files that handle different things)
The browser will receive these and put them together to display the website
The actual content such as the text and pictures is html
The styling such as colors and positions and sizing is css
Then any actions such as being able to drag ingredients or interact with the content is js (javascript)

There are a lot of things that happen on the server that we are not interested in such as processing credit cards, storing orders, sending the order to the local dominos etc.
That stuff is considered server side

We are here to be full stack web developers
This means we should be able to write code that runs client side such as html, css, and js as well as the server side stuff that goes on in the background

People who focus on the client side are called frontend developer
People who focus on the server side are called backend developer
People who focus on both are called full stack developers

You need to know at least the basics of both to be able to do either even if you only want to focus on one
You won't really know which you prefer until you build a full app from scratch

Remember how we said the internet is a wire?
There are actually wires that go along the atlantic that transmit 50tb per second with 8 wires per tube
That is how are requests are actually able to move around the world
These requests only have 3 seconds to go from the client to the server and back
If it takes longer then people 'bounce' (real term)
when someone bounces they leave because the site took too long

There are a lot of things that happen between the client and server
One example is wifi it must first go from your phone to your router
Then after it leaves the router it will go to your isp (internet service provider)
These are the people who we pay to connect to these big wires
ISP's focus on something called 'last mile' 
They are really good at connecting your house to these big pipes
It can cost $5 million  PER BLOCK to lay fiber in a city like Boston

After leaving the ISP your request will be sent to a dns (domain name server)
This is another computer on this wire and acts as a fancy phonebook
Imagine you were trying to get to someones back porch what would you need?
GPS would give that exact location
The same thing happens on the internet
When we type in dominos.com that is not enough to find the server
What we actually need is an ip address
An ip address is an exact address for a server so you can find it easier
There is no way to remember ip addresses so we use easy to remember website names
We provide these names to a dns which translates something like dominos.com to an ip address like 23.11.226.94
Then you are routed to the server which also has to jump through these hoops to get the response back to the client

This all works because of http (hypertext transfer protocol)
This allows us to make requests and receive responses

Something changed recently that made http better
Now we have https (hypertext transfer protocol secured)
What used to happen is that when your request was making this journey any computer or router in the network could intercept and see these requests and responses
Now this data is encrypted
You can still see a lot of this data but now the content within the request is encrypted
ISPs are actually allowed to record and sell this data

Incognito browsers don't stop this it only prevents local history from being recorded
It doesn't prevent any of the data from getting lost

If you don't want your isp or dns to see that information you have to use a vpn (virtual private network) instead
This is someone else's computer that you send encrypted traffic to
Then that other computer will make that request for you and send you an encrypted request back
The thing about VPN's is that it is only secure if you trust the vpn provider more than you trust your isp

There are other technologies like TOR which also work to privatize and anonymize requests but that is not important now
## The Golden Rule SEPERATION OF CONCERNS (Review)
SEPERATION OF CONCERNS
HTML = Content / Structure
CSS = Style
JS = Behavior / Interaction

The idea here is that we want to keep tasks seperate and these should not mix
If we were to go to a website and add an extra paragraph you would use html
If you wanted to make something pink you would use css
If you wanted something to move when you clicked it you would use js

This is important so that it organizes all of the work so it is easier to work on or change something
You know exactly where to go when you want to make a change

## HTML SYNTAX (Review)
We said that HTML, CSS, and JS are the lanuages of the web
(although html and css are not really languages)
NEW: We consider something a language if you can perform logical operations and get responses from them

Like any language though html has a syntax 
These are basically spelling and grammar rules that you must follow with html
For example You must encase your content within an opening tag and a closing tag
```
 (opening tag)     content
|--------------||----------|
<p class="nice">Hello There!</p>
   |__________|             |__|
    class/attribute        Closing tag
```
NEW: Attributes help to describe and format the content inside of the tags
NEW: MDN is mozilla's official documentation on the web

AR Q: What are html attributes?
AR Q: Where can you find documentation on HTML, CSS, and JS?
## LET'S CODE #100Devs About Page
Last time we took a peek at some sample html and we went through it pretty quick
We considered the following text and was added html tags in order to hold and organize it
```
<h1>First Class #100Devs</h1>
<p>We are runninga free bootcamp for those affected by the pandemic...</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arizona</li>
  <li>California</li>
  <li>Colorado</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like real time answers please join our discord here</p>
```

Notice that no content is outside of pair of tags

In the last sentence we have the word here which should be a link
In HTML there is a tag that is meant to handle links
It is called the `<a>` tag 
We have to enclose the word we want to be a link inside of it
```
<p>If you would like real time answers please join our discord <a>here</a></p>
```
Now we haven't yet said what we want to link so we can use a special attribute to supply that link
This attribute is called 'href' (hypertex reference)
We set it equal to quotes and put the link we want to follow inside of it
```
<p>If you would like real time answers please join our discord <a href="https://leonnoel.com/discord">here</a></p>
```

One thing you will notice is that the title is very bold and now our 'here' text is colored and underlined
There are still some styles that browsers apply by default to certain html tags
This is something you have to consider when building any website

The only thing to really care about is that when you write html do you care how it looks? 
No we don't because we can fix all of it with CSS which handles styles

## Why follow the rules?
Why does it matter to use the semantically appropriate tag?
There are three big reasons
1. If you do not use the appropriate tags and the correct attribute value pairs your content may not render
2. Some people are using accessibility devices
    not using the correct tags make things like screen readers have a harder time moving through the content of your page
3. Webcrawlers are used by google to list your website
    If you do not use the appropriate tags google will not rank/show your content in searches

## Time For Some TAGS
When using tags it comes down to the semantic reasons behind that tag and the importance of the content

## Heading Elements (tags)
```
<h1> MOST IMPORTANT </h1>
<h2> .............. </h2>
<h3> .............. </h3>
<h4> .............. </h4>
<h5> .............. </h5>
<h6> .............. </h6>
```
These are called heading elements
They are used to describe content after it
Think of them like titles 
Sometimes there are multiple types of headings or sections that need described

`<h>` tags with larger numbers are smaller and less important text headings
`<h1>` is for the most important content on the screen and should technically be used once per page
You should move to higher numbers when content is less important than other content

## Other Text Elements
```
<p> Paragraph </p>
<span> Short text </span>
<pre> Preserves Whitespace </pre>
```
`<pre>` This should probably never be used 
what it does it preserves all whitespaces within the tag
The issue is that it messes with positioning and spacing which is more under css


## Nerd Fights
```
<br> // used for a line break
<hr> // used to add a line to the page
```
Both of these can be done with css and are rarely used

## Assisted Device Elements
```
<em> Stress Emphasis </em> // italicized
<strong> Strong Importance </strong> // bolded
```
While this can be done with css these tags do provide help to screen readers and assisted devices
A screen reader may not pick up on this emphasis so in that case it is ok to use them
But do not use them just to style your content
We can always overwrite how these tags make the content look with css

## Ordered List
```
<ol>
  <li> Item 1 </li>
  <li> Item 2 </li>
</ol>
```
This is just like an unordered list which we have used
This expects that everthing in this list is coming in a specific order
Think of a recipe or directions because if you do it in the wrong order it will be incorrect

## Unordered List
```
<ul>
  <li> Item 1 </li>
  <li> Item 2 </li>
</ul>
```
This is just a list of stuff but there is no specific order to it
Think of it like a grocery list where 

## Containing Elements
```
<div> </div> // General containing element
<section> </section> // Groups like content together
<article> </article>
<aside> </aside>
<header> </header>
<footer> </footer>
```
Most of what we do on the web is containing other content
With HTML5 we got a lot of new containing elements
Before this we pretty much only used divs

`<section>` can be used to hold content that is related to each other
`<article>` is meant to contain things meant to be shared
  content in this tag can usually standalone
`<aside>` This is for extra content such as ads
`<Header>` Group content at beginning of document
`<Footer>` Group content at the end of a document

## Let's Look At Some Websites
Look at websites and see if you can guess what the tags some of the content would be held in
Identify an `<h1>` tag and why (hint not size)
Identify a `<p>` tag
Identify a `<section>` tag
Identify an `<h2>` tag

Find a behavior or interaction. What handles that?


## Deprecated Elements
```
<blink>
<marquee>
  
Kinda...
<b> Bold Text </b>
<i> Italic Text </i>
```
These tags are no longer used and have been replaced by css or js

## Let's Code Lab Time
Time for a lab!
In the materials for this class (see './class02-materials)
There is a `brownies.html` file we will use
Here is the content:
```

Find this recipe here http://allrecipes.com/recipe/11063/deep-dish-brownies
```

Open this file in the browser and a text editor like vscode
(hint if you have this file in wsl use `$explorer.exe brownie.html)`

We are going to go through this html file and edit it to give it a correct html structure
We are going to need to wrap all of this content within tags at some point
The first thing to take care of is the first line which looks like a title so we will add `<h1>` tags

```
<h1>Deep Dish Brownies</h1>

brownies.jpg <!-- hint: <img> tag -->

...
```

For the next line we need to use the `<img>` tag which we haven't used yet (see msn docs)
This receives a src attribute which we can use to point at a picture of a brownie on the web
Google an image and get the url for the image by opening in a new tab and copying the url
You can also add an alt tag to describe the image for screenreaders or if the image breaks
The `<img />` tag is different because it self closes because it is already content
You don't need to wrap it around the content because it is the content
```
<img src="pictureOfBrownie.url" alt="Delicious moist brownies" /> <!-- hint: <img> tag -->
```

Note that there is a `<!-- -->` tag which is a comment tag
You can write whatever you want in here and it won't show on the page itself
This is helpful to keep notes on your code

The next part is the byline to tell you the author 
This isn't nearly as important as the title above so we don't want to use an `<h1>` tag we can actually downgrade it to an `<h4>` tag
```
<h4>Recipe by: Biz McMahon</h4>
```

The next heading to show a list of recipes is actually pretty important so that can be an `<h2>`
```
<h2>Related Recipes</h2>
```
The next thing is not only a list but they are also links 
We can hold the entire list in `<ul>` tags then contain each item in BOTH `<li>` and `<a>` tags
```
<ul>
  <li><a href="#ChewiestBrownies">Chewiest Brownies</a></li>
  <li><a href="#CantTellTheyreLowFatBrownies">Can't Tell They're Low-fat Brownies</a></li>
  <li><a href="#BodaciousBrownies">Bodacious Brownies</a></li>
  <li><a href="#KatrinasBrownies">Katrina's Best-Ever Chocolate Brownies</a></li>
  <li><a href="#EasyFudgeBrownies">Easy Fudge Brownies</a></li>
</ul>
```

Next we are to prep time which is somewhat important so we will use `<h2>`
```
<h2>Prep Time</h2>
```
Below that we ahve a very short piece of text so that is a `<span>`
```
<span>60 mins</span>
```

Next servings is kind of important but not that important so we will use `<h3>` and the text underneath can also be a `<span>`
```
<h3>Servings</h3>
<span>9</span> 
```

Next the ingredients is very important so we will use `<h2>`
```
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
```
Underneath we have another unordered list with items which we can handle the same way we did above
```
<ul>
  <li>3/4 cup butter, melted</li>
  <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
```

Now we have the directions which is probably just as important as ingredients so we can use `<h2>`
```
<h2>Directions</h2>
```
The order of the directions is actually important so for this we should actually use an ordered list or `<or>` but still contain all of the items in `<li>` tags
```
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and Grease an 8 inch square pan.</li>
  <li>In a large bowl, blend melted butter, sugar and vanilla.</li>
  <li>Beat in eggs one at a time.</li>
  <li>Combine the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Gradually blend into the egg mixture.</li>
  <li>Spread the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
  <li>Bake in preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until brownies begin to pull away from the sides of the pan.</li>
  <li>Let brownies cool, then cut into squares. Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
```
Then we have a heading called 'Tip' with a short paragraph underneath
Tip isn't super important so we will use `<h4>` and a `<p>` for the text
```
<h4>Tip</h4>
<p>Aluminum foil can be used to keep food moist, cook it evenly, and make clean-up easier.</p>
```

Then there is nutritional information which we obviously don't care about so will use our smallest option `<h6>` with a `<span>` for the calories
```
<h6>Nutritional Info</h6>
<span>340 cals</span>
```

Lastly we have a short paragraph with a link on the last word
Remember for links we use `<a>` with the `href` attribute to point at the link
```
<p>Find this recipe <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/11063/deep-dish-brownies">here</a><p> 
```
