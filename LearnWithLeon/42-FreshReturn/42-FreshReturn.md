## Let's Bring It Back
I will earn twice as much as I did before the pandemic,
will have other monetary benefits,
will have dental and health plan for me and my family
and a laptop
And I'll do all that at a company that is 100% remote,
here in Brazil, is rising and seems to be pretty fun to work.
Thank you so much for this!

There was no technical assessment, I just told them about the projects I had worked on and made sure I was friendly and connected with them as people. I know there's lots of people here that are better coders than me, so it's absolutely possible you can do this!
Don't stop believing, stay consistent, and it will happen!

## !jobreport
2022 has given us the tightest labor market on record, with around two job openings for every unemployed person. To combat labor shortages, employers have lowered the experience requirements for many roles, making new graduates eligible for jobs that were once out of reach. Employers who once insisted on five years of prior experience are opening doors for first-time job seekers, fresh out of collegeâ€”especially those who demonstrate curiosity, the ability to learn quickly, and the ability to work independently.

## Trough Of Sorrow (Review)
Why does not everyone do it?
It takes a really long time
This is called the trough of sorrow (see slide pic): https://slides.com/leonnoel/100devs2-html-the-basics#/5

Leon says it can feel good to buy udemy courses but a lot of people don't finish them
I've found them very helpful myself

For a lot of people the novelty wears off and it takes a while through pursuing other means of education
Don't get too focused on getting a FAANG job - instead focus on getting A job
(Don't try to go straight to playing for the NFL - play some rec league first)

To make it through the trough of sorrow you will take about ~20 weeks of not feeling great and learning
Then some wiggles of soft hope
This is when you start getting responses for jobs and maybe even a few interviews
It is a good idea to apply to 60 companies
This doesn't mean just clicking apply this means networking with real people and talking with them
A few of them will go absolutely terrible and be absolutely bombed (10?)
Most will be alright (40?)
Then maybe 10 of them will go great 
Out of those ten maybe you will get 2 offers
Don't get discouraged and don't set your hopes too high

Right now it is about getting the tools we need to get to the point where we can apply

## Imposter Syndrome (Review)
Be wary of imposter syndrome when you are coding
Sometimes seeing other people's work makes you feel like you don't know enough or know what you are doing
You may feel like an imposter who doesn't actually know how to code
Continue moving forward and know that the information you know is valid and you are good enough to do it

## Baby Learns To Walk? (Review)
Half Hard Work and Half Believing You Can Do It
*thanks Vonds

Don't get stressed about not understanding js right away
Babies don't freak out because they can't walk their first try but know that they will be able to do it eventually
Know that you will be able to get it eventually and keep pushing

## Manage Frustration (Review)
IN THE CELEBRATION CHANNEL ON DISCORD THERE ARE 50 PEOPLE WHO GOT JOBS DUE TO THIS PROGRAM

Three key things that help people get through the trough of sorrow:
1. How to manage frustration
  There are two types of people that start to code
  One thinks that your ability to code is based on how smart you are
  It has to do with how much time you are willing to put in to learning
  
There was a famous study that came out that looked at when did people lose the ability to become fluent in a language
What they found out was that people don't lose this ability they just get older
When you get older you lose the ability to manage your frustration and discipline yourself
It is the concept that as you get older you are more in charge of your life
The mindset that successful students have are the ones that accept that they did not understand something
Instead of getting frustrated they put more time in and continue trying to learn it

2. Consistency
   Consistency is hands down the biggest factor in learning to code
   It is not about putting time in all day every day 
   It is about putting consistent time in consistently
   You don't need to do 10 hours a day you just need to be consistent every day
   
Class is about 6 hours a week (tuesday and thursday) 
Outside of class takes about 10 hours a week
The people that mess up are the ones that try to cram their studying/work into one big day
Instead of chunking huge hours that you won't be able to get just be consistent with a few hours a day

3. Ability to take care of yourself
   Most people burn out and lose motivation/endurance to keep going
   They start off putting too much in and get too tired
   Take care of yourself and pace yourself
   Be sure to eat right and excercise to keep your brain ready to learn
   Learning to code is a marathon not a sprint
