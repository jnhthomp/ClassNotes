## Fresh Start (Review)
If you missed some homework or checkins and want to be part of the things at the end of the program (job board, references, #100Devs verification)

Don't worry. There is a fresh start starting now.
Missing homework and checkins do not matter
Slate is clean.
Going forward there is an expectation that you turn in hw and use checkins

## Networking - Starts Today
Have at least 1 coffee chat this week
Alternatives?

## Client Deadline: May 17th (Review)
## Active Recall (Review)
Today it is important to actively recall much more so than the previous lecture

Ali Abdaal: https://youtu.be/ukLnPbIffxE
Active recall is when you are reading something you intentionally recall the thing you just read
It is common to read through a chapter and kind of teleport to the end without thinking about what you are reading
You are taking in the information but you aren't really processing it

When you are learning something new stop every section (paragraph or chapter)
Then think about what you just read make sure you conceptualize and understand it

Leon says "Don't take notes, take questions"
As you are taking notes write something like:
"What is a study method I can use to do a quarter of the reading but have better memorization?"
Then at the end of the lecture look at your question

## Forgetting Curve (Review)
https://intelalearning.wordpress.com

Even if you actively recall there is something called the forgetting curve (not the best researched)
Every day someone would memorize a 3 letter combo and then quiz themselves on it 20 minutes then an hour then a month later
What happened was even after 20 minutes there was almost a 40% chance they forgot it
So if you are trying to learn how to code you have to remember the stuff from the past to build upon it
That means you have to continually touch up on topics that you learned a month or even a week ago

## Resetting Forgetting Curve (Review)
https://www.pearsoned.com/three-simple-research-based-ways-to-ace-a-test

The way to "reset" the forgetting curve is repetition
If we are to review material that we have forgotten our 60% memory retention goes from 3 days to 7 days
The more you repeat review it the more flat the forgetting curve gets

## Spaced Repetition (Review)
Ali Abdaal: https://youtu.be/Z-zNHHpXoMM
Taking into account on how to reset the forgetting curve we will used spaced repetition
This means after we cover something we will retouch on the concept little later so that we can reset the curve and retain better

This is much more effective than studying something really hard just once 

## Career? (Review)
Learning to Code is the current gold rush
There is a high pay (average salary of $92,046)
Happies/highest job satisfaction

You can do it without a degree and learn for free
Offices/jobs tend to have a lot of perks

Right now there are a ton of people getting/pursuing jobs but not a bunch that know what they are doing

At bootcamps employers are asking for more people to hire than they have students

Learning to code is not what will get you a job right now
Half of the people that got a job from the previous #100Devs did not have a technical interview

A coding that only teaches coding isn't teaching you all the skills you need
What you need is to have a solid networking and building relationships with people who are hiring

The way you apply to jobs has more impact than raw coding ability
This course will spend a lot of time on things other than learning how to code

When people realized you could have a career like this bootcamps began popping up which creates very generic coders 
Even their profiles are the same almost line by line

## USA Perspective
Most of this advice is for USA based job seekers

## How to play the game?
Up to you if you want to play...
Some of the things shared tonight involve moral decisions
Leon does not care about companies. He cares about getting jobs.
He will show you how to play the game of getting a job but you may not agree with everything he says
You can disagree and not do it but doing it can help you

## Finna Make Sum Nerds Angry
Some people don't like the some of the techniques he talks about
That's fine do what you are comfortable with and get a job

## 6 Main Pieces to getting a job
1. Crafting your story
2. Online Presence
3. Hitlist
4. Interview Process
5. CAR / PREP
6. Interviewing

## Grab The Checklist
The professional checklist is used to organize setup all of your professional documents/profiles
Use this to make sure your professional presence is setup well
Much of what is discussed follows this checklist
Checklist: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L2vTX3qvLhoGHeG5cVD2ljCfRGr1uJ_Gf-hNZj9KzTg/edit

Thank you!

## 1. Crafting Your Story
## Why Are You Here
Crafting your story is about 1 important thing
Why are you here?
Why are you the BEST person for the job and why are you applying
Think about all of your highlights
Think about the best things possible about yourself
## BUT WHY?
## Passing The Sniff
Crafting your story correctly can help you pass the sniff test to recruiters and hiring managers
If you can't pass the sniff test you may have a hard time getting to the nerds
A lot of time you are talking to a recruiter who doesn't spend much time with each candidate
They take a quick check and if you don't pass an initial sniff test they won't move you forward to the nerds

If we craft our story properly we can pass this test and talk to the engineers

## Just Need To Get To The Nerds
## Then it is:
It comes down to two things after you pass the sniff test
If you can game 1 of them really really well you have a good chance of getting a job

1. Can You Code? YES!
  - We can do things that tips it in our favor 
  - show previous clients, 100 hours projects, previous projects, 100devs projects, github profile etc.
2. And do I want to work with you for the next two years?
  - We will scope them out on twitter or linkedin and find their interests
  - Casually make a connnection with their interest during the interview

## Let's Get Past The Sniff
Avoid using bootcamp or junior if you can
Nobody wants to hire a junior or first time
Avoid using those words and we will present ourselves in the best possible light
Out of the gate don't snitch on yourself
If they want to dig to get to those details then you can give more information
But don't downplay yourself off the bat!

You have 6 seconds to impress them 
Do not downplay yourself
Talk about your wins and highlight yourself

## Let's Craft
Your Story Blurb
Take 5 minutes to craft your story
Think about your previous experience in the best light possible
Say 
1. what you were doing 
2. why you didn't like doing it
3. how you wanted to fix it
4. why that is why you want to join their company

```
I am a primarily self-taught and highly motivated software engineer who has a passion for optimizing processes and creating solutions to complex problems. After a web development internship and receiving my Associateâ€™s degree in Informatics, I began work as head of logistics at a tech-based fashion startup and later took on the additional role of Junior Application Manager. Due to my prior experience, I was in a unique position to better the company by designing their logistics process from the ground up and incorporating it into their existing admin website. As an application manager, I studied frameworks and technologies used by the company such as Ruby on Rails, React, and PostgreSQL. This allowed me to lighten the workload of other employees by creating automated workflows and dashboards as well as help business leaders make better, more data-driven decisions.
```

## 2. Online Persona
Part of passing the sniff test is what you put out publicly for companies to see

## Portfolio, Twitter, Linkedin
These are the three primary resources for having an online perosona

## Twitter
Twitter is a fantastic resource for getting a job
This is because when it is time to get a job we don't click apply
Instead we will get refered into jobs

How?
At most tech companies engineers get referal bonuses
If they refer another engineer they get a check ($2k-30k per referal!)
If you can't get a referal then you are going to have a really hard time
If you just click apply and don't get referred it will be hard to get someone to look at your resume in the first place
You are going up against people who are getting referred
Them having someone vouching for them is something that immediately helps them get past the sniff test

If you have a good twitter and come across as a fellow engineer it will help to look like an engineer and make connections

Sam (Material UI):

## Follow 50 Engineers
Where you will be applying or remote #hashtag
Automate content with Buffer, but REALLY interact

Interact with content from these engineers, just like or retweet
If they don't have too many followers but see someone engaging with their content it will help to build that relationship

Eventually you can ask them for a coffee chat or how they got to working at a company

Also try to post on twitter when you can about something tech related you read

## Linkedin/AngelList
You want to make sure that you have a good LinkedIn
There are a lot of things on the professional checklist that will help you with this
Make sure you have gone through the checklist and created your profile correctly and professionally
It is important to link all your profiles together
This is because SEO will put your information together when someone googles you
Your locations should be targetting where you want to work  (Not necessarily where you are)

Andy (Draft Kings):
https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-vasquez-dev/

Join #100Devs Group: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9037281/
(Must have profile completed and get approved)

Find 5 individuals, connect with them, endorse them for JS, Node, React
We will do this several times and hopefully by the end should have several endorsements

Make sure you send a message to whoever you are connecting with!
Ignore anyone who sends a connection request without a message

## Portfolio Examples
We have discussed portfolios and their importance before
Here are some examples of how nice your portfolio should be
You don't need a custom domain name or design you can use a template

Blaw ($1000):
https://barbaralaw.me
 
Shawn (Amazon - $1495):
https://shawncharles.netlify.app

## If you need to use a template! Portfolio (Review)
```js
let developer = true
let designer = false

if(designer === true){
  console.log("Design your portfolio")
}else{
  console.log("USE A TEMPLATE")
}
```

If you are a designer go ahead and design a portfolio
If you are not a designer then use a template

If you are not a designer and you get a client USE A TEMPLATE FOR THEM
Your job is to provide value to your client
They will appreciate the cost savings you provide to them by using a template
If they had to pay for a designer to design and then you build it that would cost more money
Should you tell them?
That is up to you
Some people are upfront and tell them and others do not
it depends on what the client is looking for, if they will care, or if they will know what you are talking about

## Templates (Review)
Free (and not shady af):
https://html5up.net
https://github.com/html5up-nsm-templates

After your first client: 
https://wrapbootstrap.com
https://themeforest.net

## Hosting (Review)
For free and easy hosting
netlify.com/drop

Can also use github pages but netlify is probably easier
Allows you to setup a netlify domain for free or to purchase a custom domain

## Domains (Review)
Sometimes you can get the first year free
These are two popular registrars for domain names
1. Namecheap: Very helpful -Leon
2. IWantMyName: Sometimes namecheap won't have weird dot extensions and this has more options
OR

Just use netlify.app for free
You really don't need anything than this for yourself
Clients will want it on their own domain sometimes

DO NOT USE GODADDY
They are a terrible company with aweful support

## Resume
Template: Bob Boberson: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XgHvZ5wS6DWyqX2ABMiMq4CmGkYtDOUf/view
https://cvcompiler.com/ 

(Run your resume through to see what recruiters see don't pay)
Once we have our hitlist, we'll make multiple versions

## Cover Letter
Example: Bob Boberson: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UERcWv8rIPROZXEZG5ZFBE6_z8Yhl90ZhAla_owahP0/edit

Once we have our hitlist, we'll make multiple versions

## Github
Profile Generator: https://rahuldkjain.github.io/gh-profile-readme-generator/
Readme Template: https://github.com/alecortega/portfolio-template

use gifs of your sites instead of images of your site it will make a big difference!

On important section of the template is the 'Optimizations' section
You can write about how you would have improved the site without having to actually improve it

## PUSH EVERY DAY
## Recruiters Love Green Squares
Get green squares EVERY DAY do NOT miss a day without pushing SOMETHING to GitHub

Sometimes great engineers will fumble a coding challenge
If the recruiter looks at someones profile and sees that they have been pushing coding challenges every day
They may give them a second shot or understand it was an off day

## 3. HITLIST
One of the most important things you will ever do for your career
Since referals are so powerful we need them any time we apply to a job

We use something called a hitlist
We take individuals we want to interact with for a job and adding them to a list
We network with them and interact with them
The easiestway to do this is.... to use the sheet!

## USE THE SHEET!
NOW WITH TWO TABS!: Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Be-6gYvrfi8l-M0RnObzdysRIG7N7Yyu6rIF0OHw0Q4/edit#gid=1771441293

The new tab allows you to keep track of companies that we want to work at, adding them to our hitlist and finding their point of contact at those companies

## 60 Networked RECOMMENDED Applications
We will have to network our way in to 60 positions
That doesn't mean click apply
NETWORK into 60 applications that you get RECOMMENDED into

We are going to have classes on how to do this properly but here is the gist
For any open role you find add it to the sheet then...
## Find the hiring manager:
- Add them to the hitlist
- Follow them on Twitter
- Find their email (use hunter.io)
- Ask for a coffee chat 
- Send a thank you
- Get the recommendation
## Find the engineer on the team:
- Add them to the hitlist
- Follow them on Twitter
- Find their email (use hunter.io)
- Ask for a coffee chat
- Send a thank you
- Get the recommendation
## Find the recruiter:
Why not the recruiter first?
If you can name drop and say you know people and have talked to people in the company the recruiter will push your application
It will make it easier for the recruiter to get your application through to the next round  
That next round may be with people you have already talked to!

- Add them to the hitlist
- Follow them on Twitter
- Find their email (use hunter.io)
- Ask for a coffee chat
- Send a thank you
- Get the recommendation
## Find their Momma:
- Add them to the hitlist
- Follow them on Twitter
- Find their email (use hunter.io)
- Ask for a coffee chat
- Send a thank you
- Get the recommendation

GET A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE JOB!
