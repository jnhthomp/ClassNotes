## Networking - Next Week
Alternatives?
There will be alternatives next week if it is difficult for you to network because of location or other difficulties

## Client Deadline: May 17th
## Client Alternatives (Review)
If you cannot get a paid client right now
(due to either being unable to find one or unable to take on a paid client)

## Grassroots Volunteer* (Review)
Find a grassroots campaign near you and see if they need a webpresence
Instead of being paid they should be an ENTHUSIASTIC reference
Still go through the proposal/contract process with them

## Free Software / Open Source (Review)
https://www.firsttimersonly.com/
Contains a list of website that aggregate project issues
There should be some that are easy enough to contribute to for the first time

## SO CLOSE
Merch is going to start shipping to those that ordered soon

## Fresh Start
If you missed some homework or checkins and want to be part of the things at the end of the program (job board, references, #100Devs verification)

Don't worry. There is a fresh start starting now.
Missing homework and checkins do not matter
Slate is clean.
Going forward there is an expectation that you turn in hw and use checkins

## #100Devs Agency
\#100Devs will now be an agency!
## BUT WHY?
- Education Should Be Free
- Education Should Provide A  Stipend
- Education Should Be Practical

Becoming an agency gets us closer to these goals
This will allow people who are looking to build larger projects find developers like us to work on them
Everything will  be in the open
- The work
- The clients
- Agency income

There will be clients that come in
Tasks will be broken down into smaller tasks
People can contribute to those tasks
At the end the money paid for the project will be split between those who contributed

This will give people real ability to work with real clients collaboratively with other members of #100Devs

You should be able to get practical experience and a little bit of money

## OPEN CORE
#100Devs Stream Team
#100Devs Blog

Having everything in the open should make it easier for people to see what is happening and see the work that is being done
This will also make it easier to join projects

## Discord (Review)
List of MayanWolfe streams and what they are about (on twitch and youtube)
(Thread in \#catchup-crew channel in discord)

## Never Miss The Stream Team (Review)
You can see when stream team is online by turning notifications on in discord
Go to \#stream-team channel in discord
Set notification settings to 'all messages'

## Finna Make Sum Nerds Angry (Review)
Explaining theory to people who don't have a solid grasp of objects can make it harder to understand
This is going to cover why encapsulation and abstraction are important
Not to study dusty theories (we will cover dusty theories later)

## Objects (Review)
What are objects?
- Objects are a collection of variables and functions!
- Objects represent the attributes and behavior of something used in a program
- Object variables are called properties and object functions are called methods
- Objects store "keyed" collections

## Think of a physical object (Review)
What are it's attributes and behaviors?

## Car Factory (Review)
Look Ma! New syntax!
This is just a new way to make a constructor
Nothing changes under the hood
```js
class MakeCar{
  constructor(carMake,carModel,carColor,numOfDoors){
    this.make = carMake
    this.model = carModel
    this.color = carColor
    this.doors = numOfDoors
  }
  honk(){
    alert('BEEP BEEP FUCKER')
  }
  lock(){
    alert(`Locked ${this.doors} doors!`)
  }
}

let hondaCivic = new MakeCar('Honda','Civic','Silver', 4)

let teslaRoadster = new MakeCar('Tesla','Roadster', 'Red', 2)
```
Classes are like templates for objects!

## BUT WHY? (Review)
Why Use Objects?

## Why Would We Need A Factory? (Review)
- As our codebase gets larger and more folx join the team, can we keep our code organized?
- Is it easy to add new features and functionality?
- Can another developer look at my code and understand what is happening?
- Can I make changes without losing sleep at night? 

## What if there was a system, a paradigm, a set of rules, an agreed upon way to structure our code that: (Review)
- Made it easier to add new stuff
- Made it easier to read through what was already coded
- Made it so you were not afraid to make changes

## OOP BABY (Review)
Object Oriented Programming can solve all of the above problems

## OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING (Review)
## Let's Talk About It
## This fusion of data and functionality into one object (Review)
Music & Light Warning - Next Slide

## Encapsulation Baby (Review)
That is basically encapsulation

## Encapsulation (Review)
(This is a definition that is just supposed to help people understand
Not necessarily a technical definition)

The process of storing functions (methods) with their associated data (properties) - in one thing (object)*
This makes our code more readable and makes it easier to make changes
Our data and functionality is fused into one thing

## Complex or unnecessary details are hidden (Review)
The wand does not need to know about the water boiler
The client does not need to know the hourly rate to get their invoice

## This enables you to implement things without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity (Review)
If we were all engineers working on the steam wand we don't need to know how the water boiler works
We only need to know how the wand works

## Smaller more manageable pieces of code (Review)
This makes code easier to understand and change

## Abstraction Baby (Review)
## Abstraction (Review)
All about
Hiding details
and show essentials
Doing this makes code more SIMPLE, PREDICTABLE, MANAGEABLE

## Create New Objects Based On Old Ones (Review)
## AKA We just eliminated a bunch of redundant code (Review)
Music & Light Warning - Next Slide

## Inheritance BABY (Review)
## Inheritance (Review)
Make a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods

This keeps our code much more DRY since we can inherit common properties and methods between objects 
instead of having to rewrite them for similar but slightly different objects

## A piece of code that automagically works with a bunch of different objects
polymorphism allows us to override a method in every child class so it will do what we want

## Instead of conditionals and switch cases (Review)
Music & Light Warning - Next Slide

## POLYMORPHISM BABY (Review)
## The Four Pillars (Review)
What if they actually made any sense...

## Encapsulation (Review)
The process of storing functions (methods) with their associated data (properties) in one thing (object)

## BUT WHY? (Review)
- Made it easier to add new stuff
- Made it easier to read through what was already coded
- Made it so you were not afraid to make changes

## Abstraction (Review)
All about
Hiding details
and show essentials
Doing this makes code more SIMPLE, PREDICTABLE, MANAGEABLE

## BUT WHY? (Review)
- Smaller more manageable pieces of code
- Helps you to split the complexity your software project into manageable parts

## Inheritance (Review)
Make a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods

## BUT WHY? (Review)
- Helps you eliminate redundant code

## Polymorphism (Review)
 Code written to use an interface automatically knows how to work with any number of different objects that provide the interface

## BUT WHY? (Review)
- Helps you avoid if/else and switch cases
- Makes your code more reusable
- Supports The Other Pillars

## Let's Code
Let's Build An Agency
Build a contractor class and extend it to a front end and back end class
(The class materials have it complete, comment it out and pretend it isn't there)
Take 8 minutes to build these three classes
They should be straightforward

Create Contractor with the following properties 
  - Name
  - Role

Remember to abstract your property names to prevent name and role from being changed accidentally
Use getters to do this

Then create a `sayHello()` method to output the contractor properties
```js
class Contractor {
  constructor(name, role){
    this._name = name
    this._role = role
  }

  get name(){
    return this._name
  }

  get role(){
    return this._role
  }

  sayHello(){
    console.log(`Hello world, I am ${this.name} on the ${this.role} team at #100Devs`)
  }
}
```

Now we want to do something similar for front end
It will need to extend contractor
It will also need to take/create a new property called `tech`
Create an `sayHello()` method for this class that overwrites the method inherited from `Contractor` class
```js
class Front extends Contractor{
  constructor(name, role, tech){
    super(name, role)
    this._tech = tech
  }

  get tech(){
    return this._tech
  }

  sayHello(){
    console.log(`Hello world, I am ${this.name} on the ${this.role} team at #100Devs. I use ${this.tech}`)
  }
}
```

Then just for the sake of practice we will make a similar class for backend
Note that we would not do this in real life because it would basically be repeating a class
```js
class Back extends Contractor{
  constructor(name, role, tech){
    super(name, role)
    this._tech = tech
  }

  get tech(){
    return this._tech
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello world, I am ${this.name} on the ${this.role} team at #100Devs. I use ${this.tech}`)
  }
}
```

Lastly one cool thing we can do is to create several different objects using these classes
We can store all of these in a single array
Then we can go through the array and activate our `sayHello()` method since it exists an all objects
```js
let agency = []
agency.push(new Contractor('Bob', 'Front-end'))
agency.push(new Front('John', 'Front-end', 'React'))
agency.push(new Back('Bob', 'Back-end', 'Ruby on Rails'))

agency.forEach(el => el.sayHello())
//=> Hello world, I am Bob on the Front-end team at #100Devs
//=> Hello world, I am John on the Front-end team at #100Devs. I use React
//=> Hello world, I am Bob on the Back-end team at #100Devs. I use Ruby on Rails
```
