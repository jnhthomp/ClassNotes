# HTML The Basics
Slides: https://slides.com/leonnoel/100devs2-html-the-basics

Today and the next class is to lay the foundation for what we will cover over the next 30 weeks 
By the end of this 30 weeks we will create a custom project of our own (100 hours of work)

## Agenda
Software engineering as a career?
Learn - Course Setup
Learn - How to Learn
Learn - Client Server Model
Code - #100Devs About Page
Learn - What is HTML?
Learn - Structure
Learn - Syntax
Code - Lab Time 

## Questions
Each lecture starts with questions 
(none applicable to coding, just questions about twitch/discord)

On Sunday you are able to ask any question you want
Last sunday he spent 3 hours just answering questions
This is "office hours" and is a Question and Answer session for the entire day
That is a good time to get specific questions answered

## Career?
Learning to Code is the current gold rush
There is a high pay (average salary of $92,046)
Happies/highest job satisfaction

You can do it without a degree and learn for free
Offices/jobs tend to have a lot of perks

Right now there are a ton of people getting/pursuing jobs but not a bunch that know what they are doing

At bootcamps employers are asking for more people to hire than they have students

Learning to code is not what will get you a job right now
Half of the people that got a job from the previous #100Devs did not have a technical interview

A coding that only teaches coding isn't teaching you all the skills you need
What you need is to have a solid networking and building relationships with people who are hiring

The way you apply to jobs has more impact than raw coding ability
This course will spend a lot of time on things other than learning how to code

When people realized you could have a career like this bootcamps began popping up which creates very generic coders 
Even their profiles are the same almost line by line

## A Window is Open
First we will cover the practical things we need to learn and then learn the theory afterwords

You can learn one language to do this
Javascript can cover frontend and backend so we can learn that and open a lot of opportunities

The important part is networking and getting a portfolio/resume built up
Never just click apply to a job without a proper portfolio and resume

## Trough of Sorrow
Why does not everyone do it?
It takes a really long time
This is called the trough of sorrow (see slide pic): https://slides.com/leonnoel/100devs2-html-the-basics#/5

Leon says it can feel good to buy udemy courses but a lot of people don't finish them
I've found them very helpful myself

For a lot of people the novelty wears off and it takes a while through pursuing other means of education
Don't get too focused on getting a FAANG job - instead focus on getting A job
(Don't try to go straight to playing for the NFL - play some rec league first)

To make it through the trough of sorrow you will take about ~20 weeks of not feeling great and learning
Then some wiggles of soft hope
This is when you start getting responses for jobs and maybe even a few interviews
It is a good idea to apply to 60 companies
This doesn't mean just clicking apply this means networking with real people and talking with them
A few of them will go absolutely terrible and be absolutely bombed (10?)
Most will be alright (40?)
Then maybe 10 of them will go great 
Out of those ten maybe you will get 2 offers
Don't get discouraged and don't set your hopes too high

Right now it is about getting the tools we need to get to the point where we can apply

## Community
Discord: https://discord.com/invite/zNxhjnmDPy or leonnoel.com/discord if that discord invite expires
Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/learnwithleon
Twitter: https://twitter.com/leonnoel
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGiRSHBdWuCgjgmPPz_13xw

When you graduate and get a job the expectation is that you bring 3 more from the community with you
This means contributing to the community, answering questions, putting in time to help others

## Manage Frustration
Three key things that help people get through the trough of sorrow:
1. How to manage frustration
  There are two types of people that start to code
  One thinks that your ability to code is based on how smart you are
  It has to do with how much time you are willing to put in to learning
  
There was a famous study that came out that looked at when did people lose the ability to become fluent in a language
What they found out was that people don't lose this ability they just get older
When you get older you lose the ability to manage your frustration and discipline yourself
It is the concept that as you get older you are more in charge of your life
The mindset that successful students have are the ones that accept that they did not understand something
Instead of getting frustrated they put more time in and continue trying to learn it

2. Consistency
   Consistency is hands down the biggest factor in learning to code
   It is not about putting time in all day every day 
   It is about putting consistent time in consistently
   You don't need to do 10 hours a day you just need to be consistent every day
   
Class is about 6 hours a week (tuesday and thursday) 
Outside of class takes about 10 hours a week
The people that mess up are the ones that try to cram their studying/work into one big day
Instead of chunking huge hours that you won't be able to get just be consistent with a few hours a day

3. Ability to take care of yourself
   Most people burn out and lose motivation/endurance to keep going
   They start off putting too much in and get too tired
   Take care of yourself and pace yourself
   Be sure to eat right and excercise to keep your brain ready to learn
   Learning to code is a marathon not a sprint

## Don't let your dreams be dreams
Leon says this is the path that he thinks is best to keep from burning out and learning the skills needed
Just do it

## Course Setup
You don't need to come in with any coding experience
The first three weeks we will ease in
Nothing listed here is a hard requirement until 3 weeks in
Until then we will go slow and take our time

## Materials
All materials for class will always be on discord (https://discord.com/invite/zNxhjnmDPy or leonnoel.com/discord)
Check the #follow-along-materials channel
There will be slides links etc all used for class

## Checking In
He wants us to check in via twitter (https://twitter.com/leonnoel) because it lets people know about the class
This also helps you find other people on twitter to work/network/interact with

## Networking
Another requirement of the course is to network every week
You will network with 3 individuals already in tech
It is important to build up this network of individuals to get a job
At the end of the day it is your networking that will get you a job not your ability

You are also supposed to have 2 coffee chats each week
This is where you sit down with someone and have a longer form conversation with someone already in tech

Remember none of this starts until week 3 and we will cover how to approach these people and conversations

## Submitting Work
There will be homework after each class
That homework will always be due 1 week later
For example there is reading + watching on this first lesson of the week (tuesday)
That will be due next tuesday

At first we will submit with google forms
But later when we are more comfortable with terminal we will use github

## Coding Challenges
Eventually once we have a command of js we will do a coding challenge every single day

## Roller Coaster
There will be times where this doesn't make sense and it may get tough but it will get better when it clicks

## Syllabus
There is no syllabus
We are learning full stack js
We will cover html, css, js, node, react, and mongodb

There is no full outline because:
1. If he does that then people will drop at the chapter end
2. The other reason is people will try to do everything on the list and get burnt out

## Community Rules
Don't be a dick.

Full discord/community rules below

Leon: Learn With Leon & Friends Discord Rules

**Breaking these set of rules will result in an instant Kick or Ban from the server**

🚨 No NSFW images or context
This server should be safe for everyone. 
Any NSFW pictures and discussions will result in an instant ban.

🚨No illegal discussion
This includes any discussion about illegal drugs or activities, as well as hacking and piracy.

🚨No ban evading
Ban evading is using a VPN or even just another account to join the server and continue participating after you’ve been banned.

🚨 No discrimination
This includes using racist terms/slang, sexist or ableist terms or making others feel bad for their race, gender, sexuality or disability. 
See more in our community guidelines below.

🚨No advertising
Advertising your or others youtube, twitch, discord or social media does not belong in this server. 
This includes private study groups and other things that may split the community. 

🚨Don't ignore your warnings or mutes
If you have been warned we suggest you make changes to improve your behavior so it doesn’t happen again! 
And if you’ve been muted please don’t use other accounts to talk in the chat, or other people to talk for you. 
Wait patiently for your mute to be over. 


**Chat etiquette**

Breaking these two rules can result in a permanent ban

🚨 Be kind to one another. 
Be the type of person who stays positive and gives people the benefit of the doubt. 
See the best in people. Embrace diversity: of backgrounds, of perspective, of those things we can choose, and those we can’t. 
Accept your own failures, and those of your peers, as an important part of the process.

🚨Ask yourself
Is this the most supportive message I can send in this moment? 
If not, please choose a new message!


**Breaking these set of rules will get you a warning. Getting 3 warnings will lead to a permanent ban**

🚨No abuse
Do not abuse other players, avoid name calling, cursing or saying things others may find offensive. 
A good rule of thumb is if you wouldn’t say it to someone’s face then don’t say it here!

🚨No toxic behaviour
Excessive passive-aggressiveness, back talking other members, putting others down regularly and just being a not-kind person is considered ‘toxic’. Avoid that!

🚨No spam
Avoid sending the same message multiple times within the span of a few minutes. This rule includes emoticon spam and letter spam!

🚨No streaming games or off-topic stuff (unless in the hangout channels)
The voice channels streaming feature should only be used for sharing code or helping people learn

🚨No witch hunting
Do not publicly call out people and/or harass them for their misbehavior! 
If you catch another member breaking the rules, don't take it into your hands, report them privately via ModMail and let a mod take care of it 


**❤️ Community Guidelines ❤️**

Our Goal

This community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Applicability and Scope

This code of conduct applies to all of this community's spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the administrators.

Toward a Welcoming and Safe Environment

We hope to create an environment in which diverse individuals can collaborate and interact in a positive and affirming way. Examples of behavior that contributes to creating this sort of environment include:

•Using welcoming and inclusive language
•Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
•Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
•Focusing on what is best for the overall community
•Showing empathy towards other community members

**Anti-Harassment Statement**

This community will not tolerate harassment of any kind. 
Examples of harassment include:

•Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, pregnancy status, veteran status, political affiliation, marital status, body size, age, race, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, language, religion or lack thereof, or other identity marker. This includes anti-Indigenous/Nativeness and anti-Blackness.
•Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, relationships, drugs, and employment.

•Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
•Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
•Publication of non-harassing private communication. 
•Jokes that resemble the above, such as "hipster racism", still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically.

If you have questions or concerns about these issues please feel free to message an admin or ask for an opportunity to explore the issue with a moderator and volunteers. 

**Reporting**

If you are being harassed by a member of our community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the moderators via ModMail. 
If the person who is harassing you is on the admin team, they will not be involved in handling or resolving the incident.

The admin team will respond to any complaint as promptly as possible we can. 
If you do not get a timely response (for example, if no admins are currently online) then please put your personal safety and well-being first, and consider logging out and/or contacting the admins by email at leon@leonnoel.com

This code of conduct applies to our community's spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of our community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. 
We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by our members, especially the administrators, seriously. 
This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. 
The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside of our spaces and behavior towards people who are not in this community.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. 
Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.


**Enforcement Process**

Every code of conduct violation report will be treated with seriousness and care. 
If a member's immediate safety and security is threatened, an individual admin may take any action that they deem appropriate, up to and including temporarily banning the offender from the community. 
In less urgent situations, at least two admins will discuss the offense and mutually arrive at a suitable response, which will be shared with the offender privately. 
Whatever the resolution that they decide upon, the decision of the admins involved in a violation case will be considered final.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. 
At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of our members or the general public. 
We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.


**Consequences**

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. 
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the community and identification of the participant as a harasser to other members. 
At the discretion of the admins, or by request, one or more of the parties involved may request to discuss the violation and how to avoid similar situations in the future.

## Before You Type Anything
Ask yourself
Is this the most supportive message I can send in this moment? 
If not, please choose a new message!

## Have You Ever?
A lot of people don't make it through the trough of sorrow and it isn't their fault
It is because they didn't learn how to learn

Have you ever re-read a chapter multiple times while trying to learn something?
Have you ever taken notes? (obviously)
Have you ever highlighted notes?

Leon says all of these things are not helpful to learning

## What if there was a way to learn stuff faster, more efficently, and forever!
There are two strategies to do this below this
There will be videos that we watch for homework that will go deeper into this

## Learning How To Learn
Active Recall and Spaced Repetition

## Active Recall
Ali Abdaal: https://youtu.be/ukLnPbIffxE
Active recall is when you are reading something you intentionally recall the thing you just read
It is common to read through a chapter and kind of teleport to the end without thinking about what you are reading
You are taking in the information but you aren't really processing it

When you are learning something new stop every section (paragraph or chapter)
Then think about what you just read make sure you conceptualize and understand it

Leon says "Don't take notes, take questions"
As you are taking notes write something like:
"What is a study method I can use to do a quarter of the reading but have better memorization?"
Then at the end of the lecture look at your question

## Forgetting Curve
https://intelalearning.wordpress.com

Even if you actively recall there is something called the forgetting curve (not the best researched)
Every day someone would memorize a 3 letter combo and then quiz themselves on it 20 minutes then an hour then a month later
What happened was even after 20 minutes there was almost a 40% chance they forgot it
So if you are trying to learn how to code you have to remember the stuff from the past to build upon it
That means you have to continually touch up on topics that you learned a month or even a week ago

Even with active recall the forgetting curve will still happen

## Resetting Forgetting Curve
https://www.pearsoned.com/three-simple-research-based-ways-to-ace-a-test

The way to "reset" the forgetting curve is repetition
If we are to review material that we have forgotten our 60% memory retention goes from 3 days to 7 days
The more you repeat review it the more flat the forgetting curve gets

## Spaced Repetition
Ali Abdaal: https://youtu.be/Z-zNHHpXoMM
Taking into account on how to reset the forgetting curve we will used spaced repetition
This means after we cover something we will retouch on the concept little later so that we can reset the curve and retain better

This is much more effective than studying something really hard just once 

## Anki
https://apps.ankiweb.net

This is a free tool that is basically flash cards with an algorithm

What it does is spaced repetition for you
You review a card and if you get it right it will show it to you in 2 days and then as you get it right more it will take longer to show you the card again
If you get it wrong you will still be able to study it

This is completely free on all systems (except iOS $25 lol)

Leon recommends you only create cards in one place but review them wherever you want

## Why Should You Make Your Own Cards?
Creating cards is a form of active recall!
Using someone else's cards or notes does not allow you to actively recall
When you get a job they will use a tool or technology that you do not know and have to learn it on your own

## Why should you use anki every day?
Using anki everyday is high effort, allows the spaced repetition algorithm to work, and builds consistency

## Thank You
For putting in the cognitive effort (this is a long class)

## What is the internet?
To be clear this is a 'jobs' program 
This will cover more than just coding
To make the lessons behind coding click properly learning to code isn't just learning to type in code
You also need to understand the technologies that run our code
We will be doing full stack web development so we need to understand the technologies behind the web

So what is the internet?
The internet is like a wire

On this wire there are two different kinds of computers
```
[client devices]-------------[servers]
```
Client devices are devices that consume content on the web
This includes phones, laptops, computers etc.

Servers are called such because they serve webpages, data, and content
They will provide html, css, js to client devices

This is done when a request comes from a client device and arrives at a server
The server hears this request and responds with... something

If the teacher asked you to open a word document you would probably use microsoft word to open it
If he gave you a pdf you would probably open it with adobe

The idea here is that we have programs that we can run on our devices to run certain files

On our computers we have a program called a browser (firefox, chrome, internet explorer etc)
These browsers are able to open and run html, css, and js files and display things based on those files

From our client devices we are using a program called a browser and making requests to a server
The server hears this request processes it and returns something

Think of it like a restaurant 
From your table you can make requests from the kitchen and the kitchen will send you food
You don't really care about what happens in the kitchen you just expect to receive the food

Our browsers are made to run the files that are sent back from

For an example lets pretend we will order from dominos
From the browser if we visit dominos.com the request will leave the phone and browser and make it all the way to the dominos server
Then the server will respond with html, css, and js files (these are individual files that handle different things)
The browser will receive these and put them together to display the website
The actual content such as the text and pictures is html
The styling such as colors and positions and sizing is css
Then any actions such as being able to drag ingredients or interact with the content is js (javascript)

There are a lot of things that happen on the server that we are not interested in such as processing credit cards, storing orders, sending the order to the local dominos etc.
That stuff is considered server side

We are here to be full stack web developers
This means we should be able to write code that runs client side such as html, css, and js as well as the server side stuff that goes on in the background

People who focus on the client side are called frontend developer
People who focus on the server side are called backend developer
People who focus on both are called full stack developers

You need to know at least the basics of both to be able to do either even if you only want to focus on one
You won't really know which you prefer until you build a full app from scratch

Remember how we said the internet is a wire?
There are actually wires that go along the atlantic that transmit 50tb per second with 8 wires per tube
That is how are requests are actually able to move around the world
These requests only have 3 seconds to go from the client to the server and back
If it takes longer then people 'bounce' (real term)
when someone bounces they leave because the site took too long

There are a lot of things that happen between the client and server
One example is wifi it must first go from your phone to your router
Then after it leaves the router it will go to your isp (internet service provider)
These are the people who we pay to connect to these big wires
ISP's focus on something called 'last mile' 
They are really good at connecting your house to these big pipes
It can cost $5 million  PER BLOCK to lay fiber in a city like Boston

After leaving the ISP your request will be sent to a dns (domain name server)
This is another computer on this wire and acts as a fancy phonebook
Imagine you were trying to get to someones back porch what would you need?
GPS would give that exact location
The same thing happens on the internet
When we type in dominos.com that is not enough to find the server
What we actually need is an ip address
An ip address is an exact address for a server so you can find it easier
There is no way to remember ip addresses so we use easy to remember website names
We provide these names to a dns which translates something like dominos.com to an ip address like 23.11.226.94
Then you are routed to the server which also has to jump through these hoops to get the response back to the client

This all works because of http (hypertext transfer protocol)
This allows us to make requests and receive responses

Something changed recently that made http better
Now we have https (hypertext transfer protocol secured)
What used to happen is that when your request was making this journey any computer or router in the network could intercept and see these requests and responses
Now this data is encrypted
You can still see a lot of this data but now the content within the request is encrypted
ISPs are actually allowed to record and sell this data

Incognito browsers don't stop this it only prevents local history from being recorded
It doesn't prevent any of the data from getting lost

If you don't want your isp or dns to see that information you have to use a vpn (virtual private network) instead
This is someone else's computer that you send encrypted traffic to
Then that other computer will make that request for you and send you an encrypted request back
The thing about VPN's is that it is only secure if you trust the vpn provider more than you trust your isp

There are other technologies like TOR which also work to privatize and anonymize requests but that is not important now

## HTML5?
We talked bout HTML being the content on the page
HTML5 is the fifth version of HTML

The idea is that when it first started there was something called the browser wars
Companies thought if they made the best browser they would own the internet

The person who helped make the internet tried to get them to agree to some standards so the internet would work for everyone
This created the W3C (The World Wide Web Consortium)

## HTML5 Introduced New Features
Now that we are on the fifth iteration we have some new features
Back in the day we had to open a different program on the computer to run videos (before flash and silverlight)
- Video: youtube
- Audio: spotify
- Canvas: .io games where people are playing together (slither)
- Geolocation: google maps when they ask for your location
- Websockets: Allow peer to peer connections

## The Golden Rule
This is the most important lesson to take away from today

SEPERATION OF CONCERNS
HTML = Content / Structure
CSS = Style
JS = Behavior / Interaction

The idea here is that we want to keep tasks seperate and these should not mix
If we were to go to a website and add an extra paragraph you would use html
If you wanted to make something pink you would use css
If you wanted something to move when you clicked it you would use js

This is important so that it organizes all of the work so it is easier to work on or change something
You know exactly where to go when you want to make a change

## HTML SYNTAX
We said that HTML, CSS, and JS are the lanuages of the web
(although html and css are not really languages)

Like any language though html has a syntax 
These are basically spelling and grammar rules that you must follow with html
For example You must encase your content within an opening tag and a closing tag
```
 (opening tag)     content
|--------------||----------|
<p class="nice">Hello There!</p>
   |__________|             |__|
    class/attribute        Closing tag
```

## LET'S CODE
We will use vscode to write our code
Say we have the following text:

```
First Class #100Devs
We are runninga free bootcamp for those affected by the pandemic...

Arizona
California
Colorado

If you would like real time answers please join our discord
```
We are going to use different types of tags to display content differently
One is the h1 tag
This is for important content like headers
We would wrap the title in this like this using an opening and closing tag
```
<h1>First Class #100Devs</h1>
```

Now for paragraphs we have a tag called the `<p>` tag
```
<p>We are runninga free bootcamp for those affected by the pandemic...</p>
```

Lastly we have a list of locations
In html we have two different kind of lists ordered lists and unordered lists
Our list is an unordered list because it doesn't really matter if they are in a different order
To do this we wrap the entire list in a `<ul>` tag
```
<ul>
Arizona
California
Colorado
</ul>
```

Then within our list we have items and we mark these with list item tags or `<li>` tags
```
<ul>
  <li>Arizona</li>
  <li>California</li>
  <li>Colorado</li>
</ul>
```
Then at the bottom we have another paragraph so we will use the `<p>` tag again
```
<p>If you would like real time answers please join our discord</p>
```

Then when all done it now looks like:
```
<h1>First Class #100Devs</h1>
<p>We are runninga free bootcamp for those affected by the pandemic...</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arizona</li>
  <li>California</li>
  <li>Colorado</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like real time answers please join our discord</p>
```

We could actually save this with a `.html` ending and open it in our browser if we wanted!

Ali Abdaal How to Study for Exams (Evidence based revision tips)

Many techniques practiced by students for studying are not the most ideal ways to study
1. Rereading
  - A lot of students like to do this as a study technique but it is not particularly effective and doesn't help much with retention

2. Highlighting
  - In most situations highlighting doesn't do very much to help performance and may even hurt when you need to make inferences
3. Making Notes/Summarizing
  - Some studies show that students that are able to summarize well can do better but it is hard to quantify what good notes are
  - Many students would need quite a bit of training in order to summarize correctly
  - Even if you are good at it it is not the most optimized way to study

Instead the active recall technique is more efficient
This involves retrieve facts from your brain
Doing this strengthens connections in your brain to be able to recall it later
We learn better by practicing retrieving this information then trying to put the information in

There are ways to apply active recall to your studying
Anything you do that requires you to retrieve the information you just learned will help
1. Anki -  online flash cards that utilize active recall to help study
2. Making notes with the book closed. First learn the topic then close the book and write whatever you can about it
Then when done making notes open it back in and fill in whatever you missed
3. Instead of taking notes from the lecture write questions about the lecture for you to answer

Ali Abdaal How to Study for Exams Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is exactly what it sounds like
You space your repetition of subjects over a period of time
This is in contrast to cramming which a lot of people practice
Cramming can work well for very short term memory but we need to remember stuff for a long time
This works because of the forgetting curve
After a period of time you forget what it is you learned at an exponential rate
If we interupt the forgetting curve it takes longer to forget it next time
The more times you do this and the more spaced your repetition becomes the less likely you are to forget it
The harder your brain has to work to retrieve information the more strongly that information gets encoded for later
If you study today, then tomorrow, then three days later, then a week later, then a month later you will start to remember it better
It works even within the same day if you MUST cram

How to structure your study sessions
```
Before   | After
Topic 1  | Topic 1
Topic 2  | Topic 2 Before moving onto topic 3 ask recall questions from topic 1
Topic 3  | Topic 3 Before moving onto topic 4 ask recall questions from topic 2
Topic 4  | Topic 4 Before moving onto topic 5 ask recall questions from topic 3
Topic 5  | Topic 5 Before moving onto topic  ask recall questions from topic 4
         | Review all breifly
```

How to incorporate spaced repetition into your own study routine and life
1. Anki flashcards use active recall and spaced repetition for you
2. Practice a little every day (even just a few minutes) instead of a few times a week

Ali's spaced repetition spreadsheet  system
What you do is make a spreadsheet (google sheet)
Then make a different sheet for each subject
Within each subject use the A column to write every subject 
Be certain to scope your subjects just doing this is super helpful to understanding
Everytime you study a topic and actively recall things from that topic write the current date in the next column
Then color code them based on how well you were able to recall the information in a given session
Overtime you build up a list of your subjects, when you practiced active recall, and how well you remembered it
One thing that works with this spreadsheet is to take a scattershot approach and cover as many topics as you can with active recall
This is called interleaved practice
Before you have mastery of something you switch to something else but this gives much bigger performance gains since you continually review it
