If you can't figure it out just look at the solution and see if you can make it make sense
Once you have done a few you will start to realize ones that you may have an idea how to do if you put time into it
Don't spend more than 20 minutes on a coding challenge for now

## TURN IT UP!
## Programming (Review)
## A computer will do what you tell it to do. (Review)
The key rule of programming is that a computer will do what you tell it to
If you tell it to do something wrong it will do it wrong
If you tell it to do it right it will do it correctly

## What is a program? (Review)
A program is a set of instructions that you write to tell a computer what to do

## What is a programming? (Review)
Programming is the task of writing those instructions in a language that the computer can understand.

Javascript is readable by humans but it does need to be broken down by the browser so that the computer itself can understand it

## True Story (Review)
The homework was to watch Independence Day
We are going to use it to highlight a story that is important to understand js

Remember in the movie when aliens crashed but we already had one in area 51?
When the alien ships came to earth the old crashed ship turned back on

That means somehow all of these ships are connected
Then they used this network to inject a virus into the mothership

We have to assume that even advanced alien spaceships use the same math and physics as us
Maybe the idea of 0's and 1's are also a universal constant
Even their computers boiled down to logic gates which let Jeff Goldblum hack them and save the day

The lesson is that as you are writing js there are people who came before and wrote the 0's and 1's so that js can even be used

## JAVASCRIPT (Review)
JS is a language that we will use to tell the computer what to do
You don't need to get it tonight
Just take in the concepts and ideas and worry about the execution later
We will go deep on this the next couple classes

## Has a specific 'Syntax' (Review)
Syntax: "Spelling and grammar" rules of a programming language.

Remember html and css had a specific syntax we had to use when writing them
JS is the same way

Over the next couple classes we will introduce more and more of the syntax
Really do take care of your hands becaues you will be using characters that you may not normally use on a keyboard

## Variables (Review)
What are variables?
Variables are something we can use to tell our program to remember values for us to use later on
â€‹
The entity we use to store the value is called a variable

One of the things a computer needs is memory to store stuff
We use this memory to store values as variables so we can access them when we need them

There are a couple of different steps for using a variable
1. Declaration: `let age`
  `let` is a keyword that tells the computer to prepare a new space in memory
  Then the word after is the name of that space in memory
  So we just told the computer to create a new space in memory called age but we didn't add any thing to that space
2. Assignment: `age = 25`
  After the space has been assigned in memory we can put a value in that space
  Here we are putting 25 in that space in memory that we named 'age'

We could do this seperately like above 
```js
let age;
age = 25;
```
OR
Both at the same time:
```js
let age = 25;
```

Lets practice
We will create a variable called location
```js
let location;
```
Then the next step is to assign a location to that variable
```js
location = 'Boston';
```
or in one line
```js
let location = 'Boston';d
```

The cool thing is we can then use these variables in place of data
We could say:
```js
console.log(`Bob is ${age}`); //=> 'Bob is 25'
console.log(`Bob is not in ${location}`); //=> 'Bob is not in Boston
```

## Conditional Syntax (Review)
We care about these comparisons so we can make conditional statements
We can make decisions based on these comparisions
It boils down to if what is inside of the parenthesis we do what is inside of curly braces
```js
if(condition is true) {
  //Do cool stuff
}
```

There are three steps you can have with conditional syntax
When you hit something true you stop and do not move on
However if a condition is not true then you move on to the next if statement in the chain if there is one
`else` is used without a condition and runs if everything else above it was false
```js
if(condition is true) {
  //Do this cool stuff AND STOP
}else if(condition is true){ // if above was false
  //Do this other cool stuff
}else{ // if both above were false
  //Default cool stuff
}
```

Let's look at this in action
```js
// Declare and assign a variable
const pizza = "Dominos" // const: variable value will NEVER change & cannot change

// Check if the pizza value is papa johns
if (pizza === "Papa Johns") {
  console.log("Scram!")
  // It is not 'Papa Johns' so we move on
} else if(pizza === "Dominos") {
  // It does equal 'Dominoes' in value AND type so message is printed
  console.log("All aboard the train to flavor town")
} else {
  // If pizza was something other than 'Papa Johns' or 'Dominoes' this would print
  console.log("What are you even doing with your life?")
}
```

## ðŸš¨ DANGER ðŸš¨ (Review)
Assignment vs. Comparison
Be careful that when you compare values you don't accidentally use a single equal sign like this:
```js
const pizza = "Dominos" 

// Accidentally used assignment
// This will cause an error since we are trying to re-assign a constant variable
if (pizza = "Papa Johns") {
  console.log("Scram!")
} else if(pizza === "Dominos") {
  console.log("All aboard the train to flavor town")
} else {
  console.log("What are you even doing with your life?")
}
```
If we had used let for pizza AND accidentally used a single equal sign
```js
let pizza = "Dominos" 

// Accidentally used assignment
// This will cause 'Scram!' to be printed since it will be re-assigned and then be true
if (pizza = "Papa Johns") {
  console.log("Scram!")
} else if(pizza === "Dominos") {
  console.log("All aboard the train to flavor town")
} else {
  console.log("What are you even doing with your life?")
}
```

## Multiple Conditions (Review)
We can also use multiple conditions in our conditional logic and chain them
This allows us to check for multiple things at the same time
```js
if (name === "Bruce" && parents === "Dead"){
  // Named bruce AND parents are dead
 //Turn off the bat signal
}
```
```js
if (day === "Saturday" || day === "Sunday"){
  //It is the weekend
}
```

## Functions (Review)
What are functions?

Functions are simple sets of instructions!
They form the basic "building blocks" of a program

Functions have two key steps
```js
//1. Declaration
function name(parameters){
  //body
}

//2. Call
name(arguments)
```

The declaration is the set of instructions
Just like a variable when you declare it that function is given a spot in memory

The call is a command to execute that set of instructions
When you make a call to a function you have the ability to pass in arguments
These arguments get passed into the function and can be used inside of the function itself as parameters
```js
// 1. Decalaration
function yell(word){
  alert(word)
}

// 2. Call
yell("HELLO")
```
Above we declare the `yell()` function to show an alert with a word variable
This word variable is also oneof the parameters
When we call the `yell()` function we pass in a string which gives the word parameter a value of `"HELLO"`
Now when the alert is trigger it will show the `"HELLO"` that was passed in

## Loops (Review)
What are loops?
- Repeat an action some number of times!
- Three main types of loops in Javascript
- For, while, and do while loops
- Each type offers a different way to determine the start and end points of a loop

## Loops - For (Review)
```js
for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression]){
  //do stuff 
}
```
Iniitial expression: Where does the loop start?
Condition expression: Where does the loop stop?
Increment expression: How does the loop change?

```js
for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
```
In the above loop we are creating a variable and setting it to 1
Then as long as that variable is less than 5 we do stuff in the block (log the variable)
After that value is logged increase it by 1
This will cause it to print the number 1, 2, 3, 4

Because the first time we start this loop i is one
Since 1 is less than 5 the value is logged
Then the value is increased by 1 to 2
Now since 2 is less than 5 the value is logged
Then the value is increased by 1 to 3 etc...

## Loops - While (Review)
There are other types of loops
Don't worry about it too much, just know they exist
We will practice them more later

```js
let count = 0 

while(count < 5){
  console.log(count)
  count++
}
```
Be careful with these as they are easier to get stuck in an infinite loop

## Let's Code
Bring It On - All Or Nothing!
see 'class19-materials/bring-it-on-all-or-nothing'
In index.js follow the instructions in 5 minutes
```js
// *Variables*
// Declare a variable, assign it a boolean, and alert the value


// Declare a variable, reassign it to your favorite color, and console log the value


// *Functions*
// Create a function that takes in 4 numbers and returns the sum of the first 3 numbers divided by the fourth. Return the result. Call the function.


// Create a function that takes in 2 numbers. Console log the first number to the power of the second. Call the function.


// *Conditionals*
// Create a function that takes in a boolean and a string. If the boolean is true, alert the string. If the boolean is false, console log the string


//*Loops*
//Create a function that takes in a number. Console log all values from 1 to that number, but if the number is divisible by 3 log "fizz" instead of that number, if the number is divisible by 5 log "buzz" instead of the number, and if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 log "fizzbuzz" instead of that number

```
Solution:
```js
// *Variables*
// Declare a variable, assign it a boolean, and alert the value
let bool = true;
alert(bool);

// Declare a variable, reassign it to your favorite color, and console log the value
let favColor
favColor = 'black';
console.log(favColor);


// *Functions*
// Create a function that takes in 4 numbers and returns the sum of the first 3 numbers 
// divided by the fourth. Return the result. Call the function.
const doesMath = (a, b, c, d) => {
  return (a + b + c) / d;
}

doesMath(1, 1, 2, 4);

// Create a function that takes in 2 numbers. 
// Console log the first number to the power of the second. Call the function.
const doesExp = (a, b) => {
  console.log(a**b);
}

doesExp(2, 2);

// *Conditionals*
// Create a function that takes in a boolean and a string. 
// If the boolean is true, alert the string. 
// If the boolean is false, console log the string
const boolAndString = (bool, str) => {
  if(bool){
    alert(str);
  } else{
    console.log(str);
  }
}
// Oneline version
const oneLine = (bool, str) => bool ? alert(str) : console.log(str);

//*Loops*
//Create a function that takes in a number. 
// Console log all values from 1 to that number, 
// but if the number is divisible by 3 log "fizz" instead of that number, 
// if the number is divisible by 5 log "buzz" instead of the number, 
// and if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 log "fizzbuzz" instead of that number
const takesNum = (a) => {
  for(let i = 1; i <= a; i++){
    if((i % 3=== 0) && (i % 5 === 0)){
      console.log('fizzbuzz');
    } else if(i % 3 === 0){
      console.log('fizz')
    } else if(i % 5 === 0){
      console.log('buzz')
    } else {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}
```

## Arrays
What are arrays?

## Toasters
Think of arrays as toasters
They have slots that you fill with different data or can be empty
It is a single thing that can hold a lot of other stuff
A single data type that can hold other data and data types inside
Arrays are as big (or small) as you need them to be
An array with 4 items will have a lenth of 4 and an array with 400 items will have a length of 400

## Arrays
- A data structure to store ordered collections!
- Array elements are numbered starting with zero
  - Each item in the array is a new element and gets an indx
  - What can confuse people is that the first number that is used to identify the first element gets an id of 0 instead of 1
  - Why? Don't worry about it right now just know that this is how it works
  - `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4...]`
- Arrays have many methods to manage the order of elements
- Can be created by a constructor or literal notation

There are a couple of gotchas with arrays
Each item in the array is a new element
What can confuse people is that the number for each element

## Declaring Arrays
There are a few different ways to declare arrays
Array Constructor:
```js
let newArr = new Array()
```
Don't worry about this way too much, it isn't as common

Literal Notation
```js
let newArr = []
```
This is how you LITERALLLY create an array
You just have to assign a variable to square brackets

Instead of having an empty array we can add values to it when we declare it
They can hold ANY data type that we have used so far
```js
let newArr = ['Zebra', true, 21]
```

REMEMBER
Arrays are populated with elements
Elements can be of any type

ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨
ðŸš¨Empty spaces leave an empty element ðŸš¨

## Array Indexing
See this array and note the index number for each element written below
```js
['nyc', 'la', 'syd', 'ldn']
// 0,    1,     2,     3
``` 

Elements can be accessed by their index numbers
```js
newArr = ['Zebra',,true,21]

console.log( newArr[0] )  //Zebra
console.log( newArr[1] )  //undefined (see empty space in array)
console.log( newArr[2] )  //true
console.log( newArr[3] )  //21
```
Notice that the first element is at the 0th index and so on

Elements can be updated by using the index at that position
```js
newArr = ['Zebra',,true,21]

newArr[1] = 'Bob'

console.log( newArr ) //=> ['Zebra','Bob',true,21]
```

Like any other variable you can overwrite whole arrays by assigning an array to a different array
```js
let cars = ['Honda', 'Toyota', 'Ford', 'Tesla']
let nums = [1,2,3]
cars = nums
console.log( cars ) //=> [1,2,3]
```

## Array Length
How do you determine how many elements are in your array?
Arrays come with some goodies and functions built in
One of them is the length property
```js
console.log( newArr.length ) //4
```

## Let's Code
Array Dat - In It To Win It
see 'class19-materials/arrays-in-it-to-win-it'
```js
//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
```

Solution:
```js
//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['Shrek','Shrek 2','Shrek 3'];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = movies[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let moviesLength = movies.length // => 3
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. 
// What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? 
// Would your solution still work?
let lastMovie = movies[moviesLength - 1]; //=> 'Shrek 3'
```
Note that by using the length of the array and subtracting 1 we are getting the last index since counting starts at 0
Even though the index starts at 0 the count for length still starts at 1
So we have to subtract 1 to line these two values up 

## Array Iteration

We can go through an array and pull values out by using a for loop
```js
let bestColors = ['green','blue','yellow','black']
// Iterates through an array passing in the value and index of each element 
for(let i = 0; i < bestColors.length;i++){
  console.log( bestColors[i] )
}
```
Above we create an array
Then we do a for loop that runs as many times as there are elements in the array
Then for each iteration (starting at 0) it logs the value at that index

Since this is so common we can do this much more directly instead of having to use the iterator to match an index
```js
let bestColors = ['green','blue','yellow','black']
// Iterates through an array passing in the value and index of each element 
bestColors.forEach((element, index, array)=> console.log(element))
//=>'green'
//=>'blue'
//=>'yellow'
//=>'black'
```
`forEach` is a function that can be run on arrays
It will do whatever function we pass in as an argument for every element in the array
This function has access to several variables 
One of which is the current element in the loop

## Let's Code
Array Dat - Fight To The Finish
see 'class19-materials/arrays-fight-to-the-finish'
Try to finish in 5 minutes
```js
// Create an array of movie titles. 
// Loop through the array and add each element to the h2.

//Create an array of numbers. 
// Loop through the array and add three to each number and replace the old number.

//Find the average of all the numbers from question three
```

Solution:
```js
// Create an array of movie titles. 
let movies = ['Shrek 1', 'Shrek 2', 'Shrek 3'];
// Loop through the array and add each element to the h2.
movies.forEach((el) => { 
  document.querySelector('h2').innerHTML += (el + ' ');
})

//Create an array of numbers. 
let nums = [1, 2, 3]
// Loop through the array 
// and add three to each number and replace the old number.
nums.forEach((el, i) => { 
  nums[i] += 3;
})

console.log(nums);

//Find the average of all the numbers from question three
let sum = 0
nums.forEach((el) => { 
  sum += el
})
let avg = (sum / nums.length);
console.log(avg);
```

## Other Arrays Methods
There are other methods available to arrays besides `forEach`

`.shift()`: Remove item from the beginning of an Array
```js
let bestRappers2020 = ['6ix9ine','Polo G','6ix9ine']

let removed = bestRappers2020.shift()

console.log( bestRappers2020 ) // ['Polo G', '6ix9ine']
```

`.pop()`: Remove item from the end of an Array
```js
let bestRappers2020 = ['Polo G','6ix9ine']

let removedAgain = bestRappers2020.pop()

console.log( bestRappers2020 ) // ['Polo G']
```

`unshift()`: Add item to the beginning of an Array
```js
let bestRappers2020 = ['Polo G']

let removed = bestRappers2020.unshift('Dylan')

console.log( bestRappers2020 ) // ['Dylan','Polo G']
```


`push()`: Add item to the end of an Array 
```js
let bestRappers2020 = ['Dylan','Polo G']

let removed = bestRappers2020.push('Dylan')

console.log( bestRappers2020 ) // ['Dylan','Polo G','Dylan']
```

`.map()`: Change the value of each element in the array
```js
let bestRappers2020 = ['Dylan','Polo G','Dylan']

let bestRappersAllTime = bestRappers2020.map(x => 'Dylan')

bestRappersAllTime.unshift('Dylan')
  
bestRappersAllTime.push('Dylan')

console.log( bestRappersAllTime ) 

// ['Dylan','Dylan','Dylan', 'Dylan', 'Dylan']
```
