## Career? (Review)
Learning to Code is the current gold rush
There is a high pay (average salary of $92,046)
Happies/highest job satisfaction

You can do it without a degree and learn for free
Offices/jobs tend to have a lot of perks

Right now there are a ton of people getting/pursuing jobs but not a bunch that know what they are doing

At bootcamps employers are asking for more people to hire than they have students

Learning to code is not what will get you a job right now
Half of the people that got a job from the previous #100Devs did not have a technical interview

A coding that only teaches coding isn't teaching you all the skills you need
What you need is to have a solid networking and building relationships with people who are hiring

The way you apply to jobs has more impact than raw coding ability
This course will spend a lot of time on things other than learning how to code

When people realized you could have a career like this bootcamps began popping up which creates very generic coders 
Even their profiles are the same almost line by line

## Trough Of Sorrow (Review)
Why does not everyone do it?
It takes a really long time
This is called the trough of sorrow (see slide pic): https://slides.com/leonnoel/100devs2-html-the-basics#/5

Leon says it can feel good to buy udemy courses but a lot of people don't finish them
I've found them very helpful myself

For a lot of people the novelty wears off and it takes a while through pursuing other means of education
Don't get too focused on getting a FAANG job - instead focus on getting A job
(Don't try to go straight to playing for the NFL - play some rec league first)

To make it through the trough of sorrow you will take about ~20 weeks of not feeling great and learning
Then some wiggles of soft hope
This is when you start getting responses for jobs and maybe even a few interviews
It is a good idea to apply to 60 companies
This doesn't mean just clicking apply this means networking with real people and talking with them
A few of them will go absolutely terrible and be absolutely bombed (10?)
Most will be alright (40?)
Then maybe 10 of them will go great 
Out of those ten maybe you will get 2 offers
Don't get discouraged and don't set your hopes too high

Right now it is about getting the tools we need to get to the point where we can apply

## Manage Frustration (Review)
IN THE CELEBRATION CHANNEL ON DISCORD THERE ARE 50 PEOPLE WHO GOT JOBS DUE TO THIS PROGRAM

Three key things that help people get through the trough of sorrow:
1. How to manage frustration
  There are two types of people that start to code
  One thinks that your ability to code is based on how smart you are
  It has to do with how much time you are willing to put in to learning
  
There was a famous study that came out that looked at when did people lose the ability to become fluent in a language
What they found out was that people don't lose this ability they just get older
When you get older you lose the ability to manage your frustration and discipline yourself
It is the concept that as you get older you are more in charge of your life
The mindset that successful students have are the ones that accept that they did not understand something
Instead of getting frustrated they put more time in and continue trying to learn it

2. Consistency
   Consistency is hands down the biggest factor in learning to code
   It is not about putting time in all day every day 
   It is about putting consistent time in consistently
   You don't need to do 10 hours a day you just need to be consistent every day
   
Class is about 6 hours a week (tuesday and thursday) 
Outside of class takes about 10 hours a week
The people that mess up are the ones that try to cram their studying/work into one big day
Instead of chunking huge hours that you won't be able to get just be consistent with a few hours a day

3. Ability to take care of yourself
   Most people burn out and lose motivation/endurance to keep going
   They start off putting too much in and get too tired
   Take care of yourself and pace yourself
   Be sure to eat right and excercise to keep your brain ready to learn
   Learning to code is a marathon not a sprint

## Don't let your dreams be dreams (Review)
Leon says this is the path that he thinks is best to keep from burning out and learning the skills needed
Just do it

## Learning How To Learn (Review)
Active Recall and Spaced Repetition

## Active Recall (Review)
Ali Abdaal: https://youtu.be/ukLnPbIffxE
Active recall is when you are reading something you intentionally recall the thing you just read
It is common to read through a chapter and kind of teleport to the end without thinking about what you are reading
You are taking in the information but you aren't really processing it

When you are learning something new stop every section (paragraph or chapter)
Then think about what you just read make sure you conceptualize and understand it

Leon says "Don't take notes, take questions"
As you are taking notes write something like:
"What is a study method I can use to do a quarter of the reading but have better memorization?"
Then at the end of the lecture look at your question

## Forgetting Curve (Review)
https://intelalearning.wordpress.com

Even if you actively recall there is something called the forgetting curve (not the best researched)
Every day someone would memorize a 3 letter combo and then quiz themselves on it 20 minutes then an hour then a month later
What happened was even after 20 minutes there was almost a 40% chance they forgot it
So if you are trying to learn how to code you have to remember the stuff from the past to build upon it
That means you have to continually touch up on topics that you learned a month or even a week ago

Even with active recall the forgetting curve will still happen

## Resetting Forgetting Curve (Review)
https://www.pearsoned.com/three-simple-research-based-ways-to-ace-a-test

The way to "reset" the forgetting curve is repetition
If we are to review material that we have forgotten our 60% memory retention goes from 3 days to 7 days
The more you repeat review it the more flat the forgetting curve gets

## Spaced Repetition (Review)
Ali Abdaal: https://youtu.be/Z-zNHHpXoMM
Taking into account on how to reset the forgetting curve we will used spaced repetition
This means after we cover something we will retouch on the concept little later so that we can reset the curve and retain better

This is much more effective than studying something really hard just once 

## You Are Not Alone!
!100Devs
leonnoel.com/100devs

## THANK YOU
Microsoft Azure you a real one

## Let's GIT IT ON
## First, The Terminal
## Terminal, Bash, Git Bash, Unix, Shell, CLI, cmd
## A place where you can type commands that cause actions
Terminals can be confusing with a lot of commands and lingo
But to keep it simple it is a place where you can type commands and cause actions

## APPLE II
Emulator
https://www.scullinsteel.com/apple2/
This was one of the first personal computers available
It was pretty much only a terminal

## CLI > GUI
Command Line Interface vs. Graphical User Interface

## Let's Look
The Terminal

## Common Commands
```
$pwd
```
- (print working director) shows where you are

```
$mkdir
```
- (make directory) create a folder

```
$cd
```
- (change directory) move to a different folder

```
$cd ..
```
- goes up a folder

```
$cd ~
```
- go back to home folder
```
$touch
```
- create a file

```
$ls
```
- shows you all the files in a folder

```
$ls -l
```
- shows you all the files in a folder with more info

```
$ls -la
```
- shows you all the files in a folder including hidden

```
$rm
```
- removes a file

```
$rm -r <folder>
```
- removes a folder

```
$rm -rf <folder>
```
- removes everything even protected files - be careful!

```
$clear
```
- clears what is currently being displayed

```
$code filename
```
- Opens file in VS Code

In VS Code:

view -> Command Palette ->

Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH

## Access The Terminal?
There are a few different ways to access a terminal based on your operating system
## Windows
Git Bash
https://gitforwindows.org
(for today)

WSL (RECOMMENDED BY ME)
https://ubuntu.com/wsl
(rest of program - will walk through during office hours)

## Mac & GNU/Linux
Applications -> Terminal

## Let's Code
Normal Folder Setup
Take 5 minutes to try to create our template folder/file structure in command line
It should look like this:
```
100DevsNormalFolder
  - css
    - style.css
  - javascript
    - main.js
  - index.html
```

Solution:
Make sure you are in a folder where you want to add our template
Create folder
```
$mkdir 100DevsNormalFolder
```
Create css and javascript folders
```
$mkdir css
$mkdir javascript
```
Create an index.html
```
$touch index.html
```
Go into css and create css file
```
$cd css
$touch style.css
```
Go to javascript and create js file
```
$cd ../javascript
$touch main.js
```
Now delete it all and do it again
```
$cd ../../
$rm -rf example
```

## !raffle
## WHAT IS GIT?
## While working on a really important Word Doc what did you do?
You made sure to save it
Sometimes you might have more than 1 version of that file saved
(ex: finalversion.docx, realfinalversion.docx, finalfinal.dox etc )
Maybe you would email it to yourself?

## What if you wanted to work with someone else?
You might have to email it to them and make sure you are using their version
Then someone else might make changes with a different color
It can be really difficult to track and manage when other people get involved

## Git solves this problem when working with code
git does this by creating save points
(save points)

## Git is a version control system
A really fancy way of tracking changes

## Git enables you to take "snapshots"
This has a deeper meaning, but similar to save points

## Git enables you to take "snapshots" by making a commit
Just the term for creating that save point

## Git enables you to roll back to previous "snapshots" (commits)
You can go back to your previous snapshots so you don't accidentally mess something up
No more file -> save as -> folder132

## !raffle
## Install Git
## Windows
Git Bash
https://gitforwindows.org
(for today)

WSL (RECOMMENDED BY ME)
(rest of program - will walk through during office hours)

## MacOS
Install Homebrew:

```$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"```
```$ brew install git```

## GNU / Linux
Debian / Ubuntu
```
$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

## Once Installed 
Setup User Name and Email
Use the email you use with your github account to make life easier
This information will be used to identify taht you are the one that made a commit
```
$ git config --global user.name "Leon Noel" 
$ git config --global user.email "leon@leonnoel.com"
```

## Let's Install
Try Installing Git
*If you get stuck, office hours! (Saturday - 12pm EST)
Try to get git installed 
(not adding instructions as there are a lot of different ways for different platforms)

## !raffle
## Basic Git Commands
```
$git init
```
- Creates a special folder to hold all of your snapshots (commits)

```
$git add <file>
```
- Adds file to staging area (not yet in that special folder)

```
$git add *.html
```
- Adds all html files to staging area (not yet in that special folder)

```
$git add .
```
- Adds everything to staging area (not yet in that special folder)

```
$git status
```
- Shows everything in staging area (not yet in that special folder)

```
$git rm --cached index.html
```
- Removes index.html from staging area

```
$git commit
```
- Adds everything in staging to the special folder as a snapshot

If you get stuck in vim:
i -> then type your message -> escape -> type :wq -> enter

```
$git commit -m "text"
```
- Adds everything in staging to the special folder as a snapshot

```
$git branch -M main
```
- Changes name of staging area to main 

## Let's Code
Make A Commit
Try to commit the files we have created so far

Solution:
```
$git add *
$git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## !raffle
## Want to try something without borking all your code
You can use branches to experiment with new features/ideas without messing up all of your code

## BRANCHES
## git status
Find out if you are on main first
```
$git status
=> on branch main
```

## git branch < name >
Creates a new branch for you to make changes on without affecting the rest of your code!
```
$git branch risky
```

## git checkout < name >
Moves you to new branch where you can make changes without affecting the rest of your code! 
```
$git checkout risky
```

## Make Your Changes
Add your changes to staging
Commit Your Changes
```
git add .
git commit -m "changes made"
```

## git checkout main
Moves you back to main branch
```
$git checkout main
```

## git merge < branch >
Adds changes from other branch to main
```
$git merge risky
```
## Let's Code
Use A Branch
You can use the above process to make changes and merge them back into your main branch

(didn't do in class)
## !raffle
## What is Github?
Github is like a 'clound storage' with a lot of extra features
We can backup all of our files to here
We can also enable actions that happen and host github pages

## Local Vs. Remote
Having remote backups means it is harder to lose your work
## Not only backups,
but a whole suite of tools to work with other developers

## Let's Make
A Github Account
Create a github account that you will use in the coures (and outside of it)
(didn't do in class)

## !raffle
## PUSH IT
## Create A Github Repo
Click new repository on github

## Instructions with each new repo
Instructions for how to push are listed when creating a new repo
(for ssh there is setup in github and within terminal but should be done)

## Let's Push
Our First Repo
Follow the instructions to add your commit to github

## !raffle
## What are
Github Pages?
Github pages is a way to host your website on github quickly and easily
You can keep it up to date with your main branch automatically

## Let's Host
Host On Github Pages
By just clicking new branch and naming it `gh-pages` 
The repo will be hosted on github for you automatically
