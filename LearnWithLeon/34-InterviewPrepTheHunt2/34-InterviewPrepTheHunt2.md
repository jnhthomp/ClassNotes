Learn - Professional Checklist
Learn - Hitlist
Learn - Interview Process
Do - CAR / PREP Practice 
Homework - Start Interview Prep

## Questions
About last class or life

!ask - will be answered

## Checking In
Like and Retweet the Tweet
!checkin

## !youtube
Youtube is up to date with all classes 
## NO CLASS FRIDAY
There was supposed to be a C.A.R. class friday but that was cancelled for super review on sunday
## REVIEW CLASS
SUNDAY
1:00pm EST

## Fresh Start (Review)
If you missed some homework or checkins and want to be part of the things at the end of the program (job board, references, #100Devs verification)

Don't worry. There is a fresh start starting now.
Missing homework and checkins do not matter
Slate is clean.
Going forward there is an expectation that you turn in hw and use checkins

## Next Week: Backend!
## Networking (Review)
Alternatives?
1 coffee chat this week

## Client Deadline: May 17th (Review)
## Spaced Repetition (Review)
Ali Abdaal: https://youtu.be/Z-zNHHpXoMM
Taking into account on how to reset the forgetting curve we will used spaced repetition
This means after we cover something we will retouch on the concept little later so that we can reset the curve and retain better

This is much more effective than studying something really hard just once 

## Career? (Review)
Learning to Code is the current gold rush
There is a high pay (average salary of $92,046)
Happies/highest job satisfaction

You can do it without a degree and learn for free
Offices/jobs tend to have a lot of perks

Right now there are a ton of people getting/pursuing jobs but not a bunch that know what they are doing

At bootcamps employers are asking for more people to hire than they have students

Learning to code is not what will get you a job right now
Half of the people that got a job from the previous #100Devs did not have a technical interview

A coding that only teaches coding isn't teaching you all the skills you need
What you need is to have a solid networking and building relationships with people who are hiring

The way you apply to jobs has more impact than raw coding ability
This course will spend a lot of time on things other than learning how to code

When people realized you could have a career like this bootcamps began popping up which creates very generic coders 
Even their profiles are the same almost line by line

## How to play the game? (Review)
Up to you if you want to play...
Some of the things shared tonight involve moral decisions
Leon does not care about companies. He cares about getting jobs.
He will show you how to play the game of getting a job but you may not agree with everything he says
You can disagree and not do it but doing it can help you

## Finna Make Sum Nerds Angry (Review)
Some people don't like the some of the techniques he talks about
That's fine do what you are comfortable with and get a job

## Grab The Checklist (Review)
The professional checklist is used to organize setup all of your professional documents/profiles
Use this to make sure your professional presence is setup well
Much of what is discussed follows this checklist
Checklist: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L2vTX3qvLhoGHeG5cVD2ljCfRGr1uJ_Gf-hNZj9KzTg/edit

## Passing The Sniff (Review)
Crafting your story correctly can help you pass the sniff test to recruiters and hiring managers
If you can't pass the sniff test you may have a hard time getting to the nerds
A lot of time you are talking to a recruiter who doesn't spend much time with each candidate
They take a quick check and if you don't pass an initial sniff test they won't move you forward to the nerds

If we craft our story properly we can pass this test and talk to the engineers

## Just Need To Get To The Nerds (Review)
## Then it is: (Review)
It comes down to two things after you pass the sniff test
If you can game 1 of them really really well you have a good chance of getting a job

1. Can You Code? YES!
  - We can do things that tips it in our favor 
  - show previous clients, 100 hours projects, previous projects, 100devs projects, github profile etc.
2. And do I want to work with you for the next two years?
  - We will scope them out on twitter or linkedin and find their interests
  - Casually make a connnection with their interest during the interview

## 2. Online Persona (Review)
Part of passing the sniff test is what you put out publicly for companies to see

## Portfolio, Twitter, Linkedin (Review)
These are the three primary resources for having an online perosona

## Twitter (Review)
Twitter is a fantastic resource for getting a job
This is because when it is time to get a job we don't click apply
Instead we will get refered into jobs

How?
At most tech companies engineers get referal bonuses
If they refer another engineer they get a check ($2k-30k per referal!)
If you can't get a referal then you are going to have a really hard time
If you just click apply and don't get referred it will be hard to get someone to look at your resume in the first place
You are going up against people who are getting referred
Them having someone vouching for them is something that immediately helps them get past the sniff test

If you have a good twitter and come across as a fellow engineer it will help to look like an engineer and make connections

## Follow 50 Engineers (Review)
Where you will be applying or remote #hashtag
Automate content with Buffer, but REALLY interact

Interact with content from these engineers, just like or retweet
If they don't have too many followers but see someone engaging with their content it will help to build that relationship

Eventually you can ask them for a coffee chat or how they got to working at a company

Also try to post on twitter when you can about something tech related you read

## Linkedin/AngelList (Review)
You want to make sure that you have a good LinkedIn
There are a lot of things on the professional checklist that will help you with this
Make sure you have gone through the checklist and created your profile correctly and professionally
It is important to link all your profiles together
This is because SEO will put your information together when someone googles you
Your locations should be targetting where you want to work  (Not necessarily where you are)

Join #100Devs Group: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9037281/
(Must have profile completed and get approved)

Find 5 individuals, connect with them, endorse them for JS, Node, React
We will do this several times and hopefully by the end should have several endorsements

Make sure you send a message to whoever you are connecting with!
Ignore anyone who sends a connection request without a message

## PUSH EVERY DAY (Review)
## Recruiters Love Green Squares (Review)
Get green squares EVERY DAY do NOT miss a day without pushing SOMETHING to GitHub

Sometimes great engineers will fumble a coding challenge
If the recruiter looks at someones profile and sees that they have been pushing coding challenges every day
They may give them a second shot or understand it was an off day

## 3. HITLIST (Review)
One of the most important things you will ever do for your career
Since referals are so powerful we need them any time we apply to a job

We use something called a hitlist
We take individuals we want to interact with for a job and adding them to a list
We network with them and interact with them
The easiestway to do this is.... to use the sheet!

## USE THE SHEET! (Review)
NOW WITH TWO TABS!: Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Be-6gYvrfi8l-M0RnObzdysRIG7N7Yyu6rIF0OHw0Q4/edit#gid=1771441293

The new tab allows you to keep track of companies that we want to work at, adding them to our hitlist and finding their point of contact at those companies

## 60 Networked RECOMMENDED Applications (Review)
We will have to network our way in to 60 positions
That doesn't mean click apply
NETWORK into 60 applications that you get RECOMMENDED into

We are going to have classes on how to do this properly but here is the gist
For any open role you find add it to the sheet then...

## Find the hiring manager: (Review)
- Add them to the hitlist
- Follow them on Twitter
- Find their email (use hunter.io)
- Ask for a coffee chat 
- Send a thank you
- Get the recommendation

## Find the engineer on the team: (Review)
- Add them to the hitlist
- Follow them on Twitter
- Find their email (use hunter.io)
- Ask for a coffee chat
- Send a thank you
- Get the recommendation

## Find the recruiter: (Review)
Why not the recruiter first?
If you can name drop and say you know people and have talked to people in the company the recruiter will push your application
It will make it easier for the recruiter to get your application through to the next round  
That next round may be with people you have already talked to!

- Add them to the hitlist
- Follow them on Twitter
- Find their email (use hunter.io)
- Ask for a coffee chat
- Send a thank you
- Get the recommendation

## Find their Momma: (Review)
- Add them to the hitlist
- Follow them on Twitter
- Find their email (use hunter.io)
- Ask for a coffee chat
- Send a thank you
- Get the recommendation

GET A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE JOB!

## IF YOU EVER JUST CLICK APPLY (Review)

## 100Hours Project (Review)
Tie your past to your present and show you can code
Culmination of everything we have learned at 100Devs
Put all that knowledge into one project that we have build from scratch with over 100 hours of development

This project gets people jobs

## 100 Hours Project (Review)
For next week have the following details about your chosen 100Hours project
- Description (one paragraph)
- Wireframe (wireframe.cc, figma, balsamiq)
## BEAST MODE GETS JOBS (Review)
DO THE PROCESS TO GET JOBS

Class ended here and will be continued next time
## Interviewing
## 4. Interview Process
- Apply / Recruited / **Recommended**
  - Ideally we get recommended because you can potential skip phone screen and behavioral interviews
- Phone Screen (sniff test)
  - They don't want to waste the time of the engineer
- Behavioral 
  - These are just like a normal hr-ish interview about why you think you might be a good fit
- Technical Questions
  - This can be different in every company usually the follow the following
    - Just asking technical questions
    - Take Home coding problem (1-3 hour problem usually making a thing)
    - Whiteboard (write out code on a whiteboard)
    - In-person 1-5 interviews in a day where you meet and work with different engineers
- Wine and Dine Interview
  - This is where they already know they want to hire you but want you to meet the team and go out to dinner and whatnot
- Offer
  - Once here you can ask about the company and begin negotiating

*Every Company Is Wildly Different*

## How to prepare?
## The Bank
This is a list of problems that you should practice
There are behavioral questions that you need to know how to answer with C.A.R.

There are also 300 technical questions that are important to know the answer to

ANKI THESE!

## Behavioral
## 5. C.A.R.
Cause 
Action 
Result

Every single behavioral question should have a 3 sentence answer
1. What happened?
2. What did you do to solve that problem?
3. How are you better now because of the solution?

1. Cause
  - Try starting with one of the two
    - At my last company...
    - At my last opportunity...
  - This avoids saying bootcamp or giving the name of a specific job and lets them dig more
2. Action
  - What steps did you take to solve the CAUSE?
  - It MUST BE POSITIVE 
  - No time to be humble
3. Result
  - Talk about why your solution was great
  - How did it affect the company?
  - What did you learn from it?

## LETS DO IT LIVE
```Math.ceil(Math.random() * 22)```
to practice random BANKI questions

## Technical Questions
A lot of people are able to get away without having a technical interview

## Explanation, Use, Example
Like we have C.A.R. for behavioral we hav E.U.E for technical questions

That means an explantion, use, and example for all of the concepts in the technical section

Example: Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.
- Explanation: When you take a bunch of images and combine them into one image
- Use: Reduces amount of requests to a server because you only need to request an image once to get a bunch of images
- Example: On amazon this is also done and a lot of the images are part of a larger sprite sheet

Explanation, Use, Example

## Technical Whiteboard
This is a little different than technical questions
They are more like coding challenges whereas technical questions are responses about technical topics

## Whiteboarding
This used to be more popular
But if you want to test coding ability then using code and coding tools is popular

## Whiteboarding Tests:
WHITEBOARDING SKILLS...
Hotly debated and not always part of the process

Something to understand is that whiteboard questions have nothing to do with just solving the challenge
Solving it is the goal but they are measuring other things which can be more important than actually solving

- Communication And Collaboration Skills
- Job Specific Knowledge
- Survival Abilities when under pressure 

Don't get too pressured to solve the problem because even GOOGLE will give the applicant hints
But they can only give you a hint if you communicate your thought process and the problem you are running into

They want to know if you have a clear thought process, and communication
This is a skill that  can be learned

## Notes On The Side
First take notes of the question being asked
The worst thing is getting 20 minutes into solving a problem and forgetting what the problem was supposed to be

It is easy to forget the questions especially when yo are under stress

Put your pseudocode or thought process off to the side to help organize your thoughts for easy reference
This can help you think through your process without worrying about the syntax of the code

## Write Clearly
Writing on a whiteboard can be tough so it may be worth practicing
You want it to be legible for those who are watching

## Be Mindful Of Space
Don't take up too much whiteboard space, you don't get new lines dynamically so you can run out of space easily

You can even take large sections and use a placeholder method to 'save space'
They may or may not ask you to come back to it

## Practice Practice Practice
Practice whiteboard problem solving so that it is more natural whenever you have to do it

## P.R.E.P
Parameters, Returns, Examples, Pseudo Code

This is a strategy to get through very tough coding challenges
This is how we can solve coding challenges

You can practice this with codewars challenges

## Let's PREP
FIZZBUZZ
Practice prep using fizzbuzz

This is a classic interview question

From 1 to n print each number. 
If it is a multiple of 3 print fizz
If it is a multiple of 5 print buzz
If it is a multiple of 3 AND 5 print fizzbuzz

Whiteboard:
```js
//PREP

// Paramenters: n (number we are printing to)

// Returns: The number, If the number is divisible by 3 fizz, if the number is divisble by 5 buzz, if the number is divisible by both fizzbuzz

// Examples: 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz etc...

// Psuedocode
// start loop starting at 1
// Ensure it runs until n (passed in) is reached incrementing the counter after each loop
// Check the current value for i to see if it is divisible by 3
// If so store fizz as part of the string to be returned
// Check the current value for i to see if it is divisible by 5
// if so store buzz as part of the string to be returned
// check if the string has a length (contains fizz or buzz)

const fizzBuzz = (n) => {
  for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
    let str = ''
    if(i % 3 === 0) str += 'fizz';
    if(i % 5 === 0) str += 'buzz';
    if(str.length === 0) str += i;
    console.log(str)
  }
}
```
