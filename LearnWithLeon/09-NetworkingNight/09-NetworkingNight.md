## Networking (Review)

3 Individuals Already In Tech
2 Coffee Chats

Just applying to jobs will not get you a job
Networking is the thing that will get you a job
Next week we have to start our networking

We are going to discuss how to network, find things that work for you, and do it at a good pace
It is important to start exploring and figuring out what does and does not work for you

Next week we need to connect with 3 individuals that are already in tech
Then have 2 coffee chats with two individuals already in tech

They don't have to be software engineers but they should be in tech (but ideally software engineers)

Coffee chats should be a sit down, longer form conversation with them

In resilient coders they ask people to find 5 people and do 3 coffee chats
The reason this is important is because by the time you are done you have over 100 people that have met them, know them, and could be a referal for them

Most places don't include networking and is a huge missed opportunity since that is MOST likely where your job will come from

Right now is the best time in the history of networking to network so use that to your advantage

The techniques for networking discussed today aren't a silver bullet but are more like techiques and tips for how to network
If you struggle with anxiety/social disorders this advice may not be what works for you and you may need to speak with a therapist to come up with a plan

Most people probably think that they can't network but you can, you just probably won't like it
## Stranger > Acquaintance > Friend > Referral > Coworker (Review)
What do you mean by networking?
The goal of networking is to turn a stranger into a coworker
But the first step is to turn a stranger into a friend

This process can take a short time or a long time but the goal is to make a friend
Friends are likely to refer each other for jobs
Most companies if you are refered there are a few perks
- You might skip a first round interview and go straight to a technical
- A lot of companies pay referal bonuses (sometimes up to $20,000)
- Once you have a referal you can have a champion, or someone who will make sure you get an interview
  - This person can follow up with HR after you apply to be sure you get seen

Where people do it wrong is that they just blast someone who is in a position to give a referal with messages begging
Instead you should take the opportunity to actually form a friendship with them rather than try to get something from them

LinkedIn is similar in that you can add thousands of people on LinkedIn but none of them know you and so none of them would refer you

If you are not making friends you are networking wrong
## Read The Room
The "guide" we are provided in a second is a general idea of what to do
Read the room to determine how you should approach people at different events

## HI
## My Name Is
- Name
Leon!
- Title
I'm a software engineer
- What You Do
I help people build fullstack web applications
- Why You Are Here
I'm trying to learn how to network better
- Greeting
Nice to meet you all

## Icky At First
When reading the room adjust the template to match the general vibe
It will feel weird saying wta your title 
Embrace your inner Bob Vance
"I'm Bob Vance, Vance refridgeration"

## It Gets EASIER
Practice networking with people and meeting new people and it will feel more natural 

## ## Normal Follow Up (Review)
This is a guidline for the process you should follow for meeting people
```
Meet > Email    > LinkedIn > Twitter
     | Next Day | Day 3    | Day 6
```
In your email make sure you provide value
This just means show you were engaged in the conversation
(Bring up something from the conversation)

Then when you add them on LinkedIn make sure you also send them a message
DO NOT ADD SOMEONE ON LINKEDIN WITHOUT SENDING A MESSAGE
This is double helpful because it reminds you how you know each other

Finally add them on twitter day 6

By spacing it out like this we are doing spaced repetition to them
It will help them remember who you are!

Next time they see you they will have a much better idea who you are and at least be an acquaintance

## Want A Coffee Chat? (Review)
Coffee chats used to be in person but are not necessarily right now
When we say coffee chat we just mean talk 1 on 1

```
Email Follow Up 1 > Email Follow Up 2 > Last Email
1 Week            | 2 Weeks           | 1 Month
```
So to get a coffee chat you should send them an initial email just asking for 15-20 minutes asking to discuss how they got to where they are
Follow up 2 weeks later and 1 month later
If they haven't responded just drop it and don't worry about it

Most people will be happy to have a coffee chat with you and share their experience with you

Pro tip: If you are going to meet in person and go to an actual coffee shop, go early and buy the smallest coffee they have and sit down with it
Then when they show up you are already sat with your drink and there is no awkward situation where someone thinks they need to buy coffee for the other

## USE THE SHEET! (Review)
Networking Google Sheet
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Be-6gYvrfi8l-M0RnObzdysRIG7N7Yyu6rIF0OHw0Q4/edit#gid=1771441293

Using a spreadsheet when you network is helpful
This sheet has a place to keep networking information in one place

The spark is one of the most important things to write, the thing you remember about that person the most
