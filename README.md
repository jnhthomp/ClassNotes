This is a collection of notes from different classes I have taken to teach myself programming

The courses covered include:
- JavaScript - [The Complete JavaScript Course: From Zero to Expert](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WeY3@m_AHtqGXyn14pNbngcqdfGyzwaEtQC9ZqJwxbANxEhxc0SVoA6E37biwFuFC-PGI/) - [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman)
  - This course is updated periodically and my notes will probably not be up to date with the most recent version of this course
- RubyOnRails - [The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101swc3@NaGhHBJkkDeeSMuugRDJRNfxamXFBtSlcUlORI6d1wzSldrrbhRUv0clf3AaNqdn/) - [Mashrur Hossain](https://twitter.com/mashrur_hossain)

Especially early on in my learning career I found documentation really difficult to read and follow along with. The most helpful thing on my journey to learning to program was to 'translate' documentation and teacher lectures into something that I could understand. They have been really useful as I come across problems and being able to have a reference of relevant information so that I can have a better basic understanding when I move onto more hard to understand documentation.

## Optimizations
I started using markdown on more recent classes and lessons but some old classes are still written as comments in files of the respective language
In some cases this is useful as you can just uncomment a block of code and run the file but others it may be better to convert to markdown to improve readability


## Lessons Learned:
Each of these classes has taught me quite a bit as well as the independent study that they inspired. Some of the highlights include:

JavaScript - DOM manipulation, ES6, Asyncrhonous JS, Fundamental JavaScript, HTML, CSS Principles

Ruby on Rails - Fundamental Ruby, Creating/Managing Databases, Test driven development, table associations, websocket, backend authentification

React - React state, styling components (CSS Modules/Styled Components), Portals, Reducers, Context Redux, Hooks, Class vs Functional Components

LearnWithLeon - HTML, CSS, JS, solidify fundamental web development, daily coding challenges
