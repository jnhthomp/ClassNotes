# What is LEGACY?
___
On 4/12/2021 the Udemy react course was completely updated to be more up to date
(the original course was recorded in 2017 and updated throughout up to this time)

The course had about reached the end of its lifecycle as with how much react had updated it was getting more difficult to replace only the relevant parts of the course and it was worth it to just redo the course entirely
Now that it has been redone there is a much bigger focus on functional components (The legacy version uses class based pretty liberally), as well as react hooks.
Also instead of one large course project there are several smaller ones instead
The benefit to this is that it allows you to jump from section to section more easily and allows the teacher to update the course more easily by just replacing sections
If you want to view these lessons they *may* still be posted as a downloadable zip on udemy but if not they are in this google drive link (at least until I run out of space?): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NksZRfBtYU0G6cBz1463dC5IhviVOXs4?usp=sharing
