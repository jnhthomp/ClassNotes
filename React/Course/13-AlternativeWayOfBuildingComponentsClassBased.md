## 163. Module Introduction
In this section we are going to learn how to builld components in an alternative way
So far we have built components as functions
However in react you can also define components as classes

One important note: This is 100% optional and in most modern react projects you will probably not use this
You can skip this section but know that you will see a lot of class based components in older projects
This is because class based components used to be required but there has recently been a shift to functional components

This section will cover:
- What class based components are and why they exist
- How to work with class based components
- Error boundaries (require class based components but we will not build a lot of these)

This section holds a lot of information about reacts past, how to build class, based components, why they exist, and how they work
