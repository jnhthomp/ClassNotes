# Section 15: Building Custom React Hooks
Section github: https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/tree/15-building-custom-react-hooks
___
## 186. Module Introduction
We will continue diving deeper and deeper into react

Another core feature of react and something you will use while building applications are custom hooks
Up to this point we have worked a lot with hooks such as
`useState`, `useReducer`, `useEffect`, `useContext` etc.

Rememeber that we can only use react hooks in component functions and in custom hooks
Before we said we would cover that later and now we are there

This section will cover
- What & why?
- Building a custom hook
- Custom hook rules and practices




___
## 187. What Are Custom Hooks?
First we need to clarify what these are before we discuss why we use them
They are just functions but they are functions that contain 'stateful' logic
You can build custom hooks outsource stateful logic into reuseable functions

Unlike regular functions custom hooks can use other react hooks and react state
With custom hooks you can outsource logic you might use in different components to a custom hook
Then this custom hook can be used within different components
Think of it as a mechanism to reuse logic
It is like a regular function except we are allowed to use react hooks inside




___
## 188. Creating a Custom React Hook Function
For this excercise we will use a sample project 
This will only be used for the next few lessons while we learn before we move on to a bigger project
You can find the sample starting code here: https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/tree/15-building-custom-react-hooks/code/01-starting-project

This app just has two counters, one counts up and the other counts down
You can see there are only three components (other than `<App>`)
One component is a card which is used for wrapping/styling the other two are the backwards and forwards counters
You can see that they both manage their own state and use `useEffect` with an interval set to increase/decrease the value in state when the interval is met
This will update state which will start the counter again due to the empty dependency array in `useEffect` which causes it to run on every component reload

These two components are pretty similar
In a real application you may have different components which to a certain extent do related tasks
Here we can see that we have quite a bit of code duplication in our forwards and backwards counter since they are both doing the same thing
One just shows the positive value of a number and the other shows the negative value
However they are both updating a number at the same interval and both should stay in sync on the 'same' but opposite numbers

We want to refactor this to create a function that allows our counters to share code
The issue is that the code we want to duplicate uses hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`

To create a custom hook we create a new folder called hooks under our src folder
create: src/hooks

Then we will create a file to hold our function 
create: src/hooks/use-counter.js

We can name the file whatever we want but the function name inside of this file does need to start with `use`
This function MUST start with 'use' 
This signals to react that it will call react hooks and is a promise to react that we will only call this function in places where we can call hooks
Otherwise if you were to use react hooks in custom hooks and then use the custom hook in the wrong place you would be using react hooks in the wrong place
Some editors will give you a warning if you start a function with use and then start to use it in the wrong place
First create our function and export it
```js
const useCounter = () => {

};

export default useCounter;
```

Now we can start adding the logic we want to reuse
If we start with the forward counter we can just copy our `useState` and `useEffect` code
Be careful not to take any of the return jsx from `<ForwardCounter>`

Since we are using `useState` and `useEffect` now within `use-counter.js` we will need to import them
```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const useCounter = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);
};

export default useCounter;
```

Now we have our logic in a custom hook function but still want to use it in the forward counter




___
## 189. Using Custom Hooks
Now that we have created our custom hook we need to use it
It turns out that we can use custom hooks the same way we use built in hooks
We just have to call it like a function

First we have to import it
```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import useCounter from '../hooks/use-counter.js';
...
```

Then within the `<ForwardCounter>` we can call `useCounter`
If we are to call a hook that sets state within another component (like we will here with `useCounter` and `<ForwardCounter>`) then that state will be registered to that component as if it was called within that component
The state created within `useCounter` it will be tied to `<ForwardCounter>`
If we call `useCounter` again in another component (like `<BackwardCounter>`) that component will have it's OWN state to manage as well
Using a custom hook to set a state is the same as using a regular hook to set a state, that state is tied to the component it is called in
Only the logic is shared not the state values

Within the `<ForwardCounter>` we can call our hook
```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import useCounter from '../hooks/use-counter.js';

import Card from './Card';

const ForwardCounter = () => {
  useCounter();
  ...
```
Now we have added the hook but we don't have access to any of the values because it isn't assigned to any variable
We can make this happen the same way we do for `useState` 
`useState` returns an array that we destructure
Therefore we can have our custom hook return our counter value in a return and capture it in a variable when we call `useCounter`

First return our state value
```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const useCounter = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return counter;
};

export default useCounter;
```

Then capture this value when we call `useCounter`
This also allows us to remove all the old `useState` and `useEffect` logic including removing the imports
```js
import useCounter from '../hooks/use-counter.js';

import Card from './Card';

const ForwardCounter = () => {
  const counter = useCounter();

  return <Card>{counter}</Card>;
};

export default ForwardCounter;

```

Now if we save and reload the counter should work just as before but now with a custom hook




___
## 190. Configuring Custom Hooks
Now in the `<BackwardCouter>` component we are using the same logic that we were using in the `<ForwardCounter>`
The only difference is subtracting 1 each `setInterval` instead of adding one

We can still use our custom hook this in our component
We just need to make it more re-usable by allowing it accept arguments just like other hooks can

We could expect any calls to `useCounter` to pass in a counter updating function like this:
```js
const useCounter = (counterUpdateFn) => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCounter(counterUpdateFn()); // counterUpdatFn = (prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return counter;
};
```

That is pretty flexible but takes more work each time we call it
We could make it less flexible by just expecting a boolean flag (called forwards)
If it is true the counter will count positive
If it is false the counter will count negative
Don't for
Like this:
```js
const useCounter = (forward = true) => { // forward = true sets a default value, overwritten if a value is passed in
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      // If forward was ommited or set to true when passed
      if(forward){
        setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter + 1);
      } else{ // false (or anything other than 'true' was passed) uses backward counter
        setCounter((prevCounter) => prevCounter - 1);
      }
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [forward]);// Must add forward as dependency as it is not defined within useEffect and passed from outside

  return counter;
};
```

Now that we have a way to differentiate between counting forwards and backwards within our state when we call our hook we can use it in the `<BackwardCounter>`

We can import and call it just like we did before and make sure we are saving the returned value then output it in jsx
```js
import useCounter from '../hooks/use-counter';

import Card from './Card';

const BackwardCounter = () => {
  const counter = useCounter(false);

  return <Card>{counter}</Card>;
};

export default BackwardCounter;
```

We don't need to specify `true` in the `<ForwardCounter>` because we set that as the default value within `useCounter` although you could pass true in for clarity if you wanted

## 191. Onwards To A More Realistic Example
Now to use what we have learned in a more realistic scenario
Use the starter project in the following github repo:
github: https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/tree/15-building-custom-react-hooks/code/04-onwards-to-a-more-realistic-example

<center>ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨Important Make sure you replace the firebase link in App AND NewTask components<br>
Point to your own firebase that was set up in section 14<br>
Be sure to keep the '/tasks.json' endingðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨</center>

This app is just a simple task app that will use http requests to add and fetch new tasks like we learned in the last section

Adding tasks should add tasks to your firebase realtime database
Make sure that works before moving on and if it doesn't double check that you updated the link properly in the fetch request in both `<App>` and `<NewTask>`

This works with sending http requests with the fetch api, handling errors and loading, transforming the data all of which we learned last section

Importantly in `<App>` we are fetching tasks with `fetchTask`
This is done on component load because of `useEffect` or because inside of `<Tasks>` a button was clicked if there was an error that willt ry again
Then in `<NewTask>` there is a post requests which we are using to add new task data to firebase
This function is triggered when the task form is submitted

Explore the code if you don't understand so you can follow what is happening
This gives us another chance of adding a custom hook

We have two very similar operations
One is the `<NewTask>` component when we send a request to store data and in `<App>` when we send the request to get data
We can use a hook to put both of these in a single hook and call whichever function we need as we need it
In both components we are managing a loading and error state in the same way and also have the same error handling logic
Because of this we should pull it out and put it in a custom hook
It cannot be a regular function because both of these require state management




___
## 192. Building A Custom Http Hook
Now to build out our custom hook
Remember first we need to build a new folder/file
create: src/hooks/use-http.js

Then inside we can start writing our hook function
```js
const useHttp = () => {
  
};

export default useHttp;
```

Now we can think about what kind of logic we want to outsource
1. The loading and error state
2. Post/fetch functionality
3. Error handling 

We can go to the component and grab the `fetchTasks` function and state functions we use and copy them into our new hook
We don't need  the `tasks` state though so we can delete that
We will keep the loading and error state though
Remember we also need to import our hooks
We will also change the name of our function from `fetchTasks` to `sendRequest` as we will make it more generic so that it doesn't only have to be used for fetching tasks
In theory we might be able to use it for a different fetch/push request entirely if we make it reusable enough
```js
import { useState } from 'react';

const useHttp = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  const sendRequest = async (taskText) => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        'https://link-to-firebase-url-rtdb.firebaseio.com/tasks.json'
      );

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Request failed!');
      }

      const data = await response.json();

      const loadedTasks = [];

      for (const taskKey in data) {
        loadedTasks.push({ id: taskKey, text: data[taskKey].text });
      }

      setTasks(loadedTasks);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err.message || 'Something went wrong!');
    }
    setIsLoading(false);
  };
}; 

export default useHttp;
```

So what can we make configurable in here?
We could make the url configurable so we could send requests to different firebase urls if we wished
The method, body, and headers should also be configurable
To do this we will expect an object that has all of these config options specified
```js
const useHttp = (requestConfig) => {
  ...
```

Then we can replace the url we specified with the `requestConfig.url` that we are expecting to get
```js
try {
  const response = await fetch(
    requestConfig.url
  );
```
Since we will want to use this hook for both GET and POST requests we should include another argument to fetch where we pass in an object describing our request in more detail
Remember by default fetch will use GET as the method
Since we want to do post requests also whenever we call this hook the object we pass in (`requestConfig`) will have all of these options specified
```js
    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        requestConfig.url, {
          method: requestConfig.method,
          headers: requestConfig.headers,
          body: JSON.stringify(requestConfig.body)
        }
      );
```
By using `JSON.stringify` the body itself is passed in as regular js object but is converted to json before we submit it

Now our request and how it is sent is more configurable
If we were to pass in two different objects we could get two different requests
```js
// GET object ex:
const requestConfig = {
  url: 'https://link-to-firebase-url-rtdb.firebaseio.com/tasks.json',
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {},
  body: null
}

// POST object ex
const requestConfig = {
  url: 'https://link-to-firebase-url-rtdb.firebaseio.com/tasks.json',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          },
  body: {text: taskText}
}
```

Now in our code we are making a configurable request, and the response will get saved to an object
Since we are passing in the new value to be added via this `requestConfig.body` key we can remove the `taskText` variable in `sendRequest`
We check the `.ok` value of that object which is expected to be returned by the server to tell us if our request was successful or not
If not we create an error object which will throw us into the `catch` block
If there is no error we save the data from the response and convert it from a json object to a javascript object
```js
const useHttp = (requestConfig) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  const sendRequest = async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        requestConfig.url, {
          method: requestConfig.method,
          headers: requestConfig.headers,
          body: JSON.stringify(requestConfig.body)
        }
      );

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Request failed!');
      }

      const data = await response.json();
```

Below that we within the try block is actually not important to our hook as we don't need to save any of the tasks since this hook will not be managing those tasks
So we can remove the array, for loop, and `setTasks` call

To keep this configurable we will expect a function to format the data we have saved
That way when we call this hook we can manipulate the data object in a way that makes sense for the type of request calling it
For example on a get request the data object will be the list of tasks which we will need to process to output
However for a post request it may just be an object saying the post was successful
```js
import { useState } from 'react';

const useHttp = (requestConfig, applyData) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  const sendRequest = async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        requestConfig.url, {
          method: requestConfig.method,
          headers: requestConfig.headers,
          body: JSON.stringify(requestConfig.body)
        }
      );

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Request failed!');
      }

      const data = await response.json();
      applyData(data);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err.message || 'Something went wrong!');
    }
    setIsLoading(false);
  };
}; 

export default useHttp;
```
Now we have the two states that are being managed and the `sendRequest` function listed
We still need to make these states available to the component that calls it as well as the `sendRequest` function

So at the end of our custom hook we need to return something that allows us to access these
We can return an object that has these values/functions available
```js
const useHttp = (requestConfig, applyData) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  const sendRequest = async () => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        requestConfig.url, {
          method: requestConfig.method,
          headers: requestConfig.headers,
          body: JSON.stringify(requestConfig.body)
        }
      );

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Request failed!');
      }

      const data = await response.json();
      applyData(data);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err.message || 'Something went wrong!');
    }
    setIsLoading(false);
  };

  return {
    isLoading: isLoading,
    error: error,
    sendRequest: sendRequest
  }
}; 
```

Since we are using matching names we can use a javascript shortcut
```js
return {
  isLoading,
  error,
  sendRequest
}
```
This does the same thing as the previous return statement just with a different/shorter syntax

## 193. Using the Custom Http Hook
Now we need to use our custom hook in our `<App>` component
First we need to import it
```js
...
import NewTask from './components/NewTask/NewTask';
import useHttp from './hooks/use-http.js';
...
```

Then we can get rid of the `isLoading` and `error` states since these are taken care of in `useHttp`
Instead we can just call `useHttp`
Just to be safe we will call it after initializing `tasks` state since we will want to use the return of `useHttp` to manipulate `tasks` state
```js

function App() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
  useHttp();
  ...
```

Now remember `useHttp` is expecting some arguments
The first is an object containing the `requestConfig` options to set
The second is a function we will apply to any data we receive back
So within `<App>` we will need pass in this object
However there are some values that we don't need to pass from `<App>` since it is only doing a GET request such as `headers` and `body` 
We don't want to force people to include that data when it will not be used so we will tweak the `useHttp` so that it sets default values for these if none are provided
We can do this by checking if a value was passed and if not set a default value ourselves
```js
const response = await fetch(
  requestConfig.url, {
    // Check if .method exists, if so use value if not use 'GET'
    method: requestConfig.method ? requestConfig.method: 'GET',
    // Check if .headers exist if so use value if not use empty object
    headers: requestConfig.headers ? requestConfig.headers: {},
    // Check if .body exists if so use value if not set null
    body: requestConfig.body ? JSON.stringify(requestConfig.body) : null
  } 
```

Doing this will prevent us from having to pass in unnecessary information when doing get requests since they require very little input other than a url

Now our hook should be flexible enough that if we are just making a GET request we can just pass the url we want to visit in

We do still need to provide a method to handle the receiving of the data from the request though
Remember we expect to receive that function and then later call it passing in data as an argument
If we define a function within `<App>` we should have access to whatever object data receives (which should be a list of tasks)
Within that function we are going to want to transform the data in the way that we were previously doing in the `<App>` component

Before we set an empty array to a variable then used a for loop to go through the data that was received
Then we add each object from the received data (which is a js object since it was transform from json within `useHttp`) to the empty array with `.push`
Once the for loop is over the array has been built and we submit that as the new `tasks` state value
```js
function App() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);

  const transformTasks = (tasksObj) => {
    const loadedTasks = [];

    for (const taskKey in tasksObj) {
      loadedTasks.push({ id: taskKey, text: tasksObj[taskKey].text });
    }

    setTasks(loadedTasks);
  };
  
```

Now we have transformed the tasks from regular objects sturctured how firebase wanted them to now be useable by our application and saved the object to our state
We just need to provide this function to `useHttp` so it can call it whenever it needs
```js
useHttp({ url: 'https://link-to-firebase-url-rtdb.firebaseio.com/tasks.json'}, transformTasks);
```

Now we have the main logic in the custom hooks but data specific logic in the place where we need the data

Remember `useHttp` is also returning a value which is an object holding the state values we need to access to determine how our page should look during errors and loading as well as the function we need to perform the http request in general

We can save an access this object by using object destructuring just like we did with array destructuring with built in react hooks
We can use the normal names for `isLoading` and `error` but for the sake of clarity will change the name of `sendRequest` to `fetchData` to be more descriptive of what it actually does
```js
const { isLoading, error, sendRequest: fetchTasks } = useHttp(
  { url: 'https://link-to-firebase-url-rtdb.firebaseio.com/tasks.json'},
    transformTasks
);
```

Now we no longer need the old `fetchTasks` that was in `<App>`
Be careful not to remove the `useEffect` hook that calls `fetchTasks` though since we will need it to call the function returned by our custom hook
We SHOULD add `fetchTasks` as a dependency to `useEffect` since react doesn't know about it and doesn't know that it will never change (it might actually)
However we cannot right now because it would trigger an infinite loop, we will fix this later

Now our `<App>` component is restructured so that it still has access to the `isLoading` and `error` states and `fetchTasks` but the logic for all of that is built into our custom hook
If we save and reload we should be able to see our tasks and add new tasks still
```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

import Tasks from './components/Tasks/Tasks';
import NewTask from './components/NewTask/NewTask';
import useHttp from './hooks/use-http.js';

function App() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);

  const transformTasks = (tasksObj) => {
    const loadedTasks = [];

    for (const taskKey in tasksObj) {
      loadedTasks.push({ id: taskKey, text: tasksObj[taskKey].text });
    }

    setTasks(loadedTasks);
  };
  
  const { isLoading, error, sendRequest: fetchTasks } = useHttp(
    { url: 'https://link-to-firebase-url-rtdb.firebaseio.com/tasks.json'},
      transformTasks
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchTasks();
  }, []);

  const taskAddHandler = (task) => {
    setTasks((prevTasks) => prevTasks.concat(task));
  };

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <NewTask onAddTask={taskAddHandler} />
      <Tasks
        items={tasks}
        loading={isLoading}
        error={error}
        onFetch={fetchTasks}
      />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

export default App;

```

It isn't finished yet as we are not using `useEffect` in a best practice way since we haven't added `fetchTasks` as a dependency




___
## 194. Adjusting the Custom Hook Logic
We should add `fetchTasks` as a dependency to `useEffect` but if we do we will cause an infinite loop
This is because if we do this the fetchTasks will be re-initialized each time because when the component loads `useHttp` is called to set the value for fetchTasks which re-initializes a function
Remember like arrays and objects it isn't the VALUE but rather the object itself in memory that is changed every time which react counts as a change

To counter this we need to do this as a callback function 
That way react can track that it is the same function being recreated and not register as a change every time it is re-initialized 

We do this by going to `useHttp` and wrapping our `sendRequest` function in `useCallback` because this is the function that is getting assigned to `fetchTasks`
```js
const sendRequest = useCallback(async () => {
  setIsLoading(true);
  setError(null);
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      requestConfig.url, {
        method: requestConfig.method ? requestConfig.method: 'GET',
        headers: requestConfig.headers ? requestConfig.headers: {},
        body: requestConfig.body ? JSON.stringify(requestConfig.body) : null
      }
    );

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Request failed!');
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    applyData(data);
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err.message || 'Something went wrong!');
  }
  setIsLoading(false);
});
```

Then remember the other argument for `useCallback` (besides the function we want to apply it to) is a dependency array
This dependency array needs to list everything that is being used in `sendRequest` that isn't created inside `sendRequest`
So we looking at `sendRequest` we can look for any data that originated outside of `sendRequest`
- `setIsLoading` is a `setState` method which react guarantees to be the same so we don't need to list this
- `setError` same as `setIsLoading`
- `fetch` default js function so not needed
- `requestConfig` Yes this is needed
- `applyData` Also needed
```js
const sendRequest = useCallback(async () => {
  setIsLoading(true);
  setError(null);
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      requestConfig.url, {
        method: requestConfig.method ? requestConfig.method: 'GET',
        headers: requestConfig.headers ? requestConfig.headers: {},
        body: requestConfig.body ? JSON.stringify(requestConfig.body) : null
      }
    );

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Request failed!');
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    applyData(data);
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err.message || 'Something went wrong!');
  }
  setIsLoading(false);
},[requestConfig, applyData]);
```

The issue with this is that `requestConfig` is a js object and `applyData` is a js function
This means if we were to list them as dependencies it would cause another infinite loop
So we need to go back to `<App>` where these two values are created and passed in and call `useCallback` on them as well before we add them as dependencies

In `<App>` the function that is eventually `applyData` is called `transformTasks` which we want to wrap in `useCallback` 
We can use an empty dependency array because there is nothing changing within our function
Although the value of `tasksObj` changes the fact that it exists and how it is used does not change which is what is important
```js
const transformTasks = useCallback((tasksObj) => {
  const loadedTasks = [];

  for (const taskKey in tasksObj) {
    loadedTasks.push({ id: taskKey, text: tasksObj[taskKey].text });
  }

  setTasks(loadedTasks);
}, []);
```

Now we have guaranteed that `transFormedTasks` (and therefore `applyData`) is not recreated all the time but how about `requestConfig`?
To do this we could just change our custom hook
Currently we are expecting to receive `requestConnfig` in the hook itself but we really only use it in `sendRequest`
We could instead expect to receive it whenever `sendRequest` is called
```js
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const useHttp = (applyData) => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  const sendRequest = useCallback(async (requestConfig) => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        requestConfig.url, {
          method: requestConfig.method ? requestConfig.method: 'GET',
          headers: requestConfig.headers ? requestConfig.headers: {},
          body: requestConfig.body ? JSON.stringify(requestConfig.body) : null
        }
      );

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Request failed!');
      }

      const data = await response.json();
      applyData(data);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err.message || 'Something went wrong!');
    }
    setIsLoading(false);
  },[applyData]);

  return {
    isLoading: isLoading,
    error: error,
    sendRequest: sendRequest
  }
}; 

export default useHttp;
```
Notice now we don't need to list `requestConfig` as a dependency since it is an argument (just like with `transformTasks` not needing `tasksObj` listed)

Now in `<App>` all we have to do is remove the object with the url from the arguments in `useHttp` and add it as an argument to `fetchTasks`
```js
import React, { useEffect, useState, useCallback } from 'react';

import Tasks from './components/Tasks/Tasks';
import NewTask from './components/NewTask/NewTask';
import useHttp from './hooks/use-http.js';

function App() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);

  const transformTasks = useCallback((tasksObj) => {
    const loadedTasks = [];

    for (const taskKey in tasksObj) {
      loadedTasks.push({ id: taskKey, text: tasksObj[taskKey].text });
    }

    setTasks(loadedTasks);
  }, []);
  
  const { isLoading, error, sendRequest: fetchTasks } = useHttp(transformTasks);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchTasks({ url: 'https://link-to-firebase-url-rtdb.firebaseio.com/tasks.json' });
  }, []);

  const taskAddHandler = (task) => {
    setTasks((prevTasks) => prevTasks.concat(task));
  };

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <NewTask onAddTask={taskAddHandler} />
      <Tasks
        items={tasks}
        loading={isLoading}
        error={error}
        onFetch={fetchTasks}
      />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

export default App;

```
We could even take this a step further
We aren't using `applyData` outside of `sendRequest` within `useHttp`
So that means we could expect it as an argument to `fetchTasks` which means we wouldn't need to list it as a dependency in `sendRequest` just like we did with `requestConfig`
Then we wouldn't need `useCallback` on `transformTasks`
We would just need to create `transformTasks` inside of `useEffect` so that way it wouldn't need to be a dependency there and we can avoid needing `useCallback`

First in `<App>` remove `useCallback` from `transformTasks`
Then move the `transformTasks` declaration into `useEffect` 
Remember to remove the `transformTasks` argument from `useHttp`
```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

import Tasks from './components/Tasks/Tasks';
import NewTask from './components/NewTask/NewTask';
import useHttp from './hooks/use-http.js';

function App() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
  
  const { isLoading, error, sendRequest: fetchTasks } = useHttp();

  useEffect(() => {

    const transformTasks = (tasksObj) => {
      const loadedTasks = [];

      for (const taskKey in tasksObj) {
        loadedTasks.push({ id: taskKey, text: tasksObj[taskKey].text });
      }

      setTasks(loadedTasks);
    };

    fetchTasks({ url: 'https://link-to-firebase-url-rtdb.firebaseio.com/tasks.json' }, transformTasks);
  }, [fetchTasks]);

  const taskAddHandler = (task) => {
    setTasks((prevTasks) => prevTasks.concat(task));
  };

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <NewTask onAddTask={taskAddHandler} />
      <Tasks
        items={tasks}
        loading={isLoading}
        error={error}
        onFetch={fetchTasks}
      />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

export default App;

```
Notice that `fetchTasks` is now listed as a dependency to `useEffect` without issue because we have used `useCallback` in `useHttp` and `fetchTasks` originates outside of `useEffect`

Now we can go to `useHttp` and move the argument from being applied to the hook itself but rather to the `sendRequest` function
```js
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const useHttp = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  const sendRequest = useCallback(async (requestConfig, applyData) => {
    setIsLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        requestConfig.url, {
          method: requestConfig.method ? requestConfig.method: 'GET',
          headers: requestConfig.headers ? requestConfig.headers: {},
          body: requestConfig.body ? JSON.stringify(requestConfig.body) : null
        }
      );

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Request failed!');
      }

      const data = await response.json();
      applyData(data);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err.message || 'Something went wrong!');
    }
    setIsLoading(false);
  },[]);

  return {
    isLoading: isLoading,
    error: error,
    sendRequest: sendRequest
  }
}; 

export default useHttp;
```
Notice now the `useCallback` function around `sendRequest` no longer needs any dependencies since `requestConfig` and `applyData` are now arguments and not considered originating outside of the funtion

Now we should have a custom hook that fetches the data without any issues

Notice that there were a few ways we could have gone about this, the other solution with having `transformData` wrapped in `useCallback` and expecting those arguments in `useHttp` would have been fine
This way was just another way of doing it that reduced the need for depenedencies and `useCallback` functions

## 195. Using The Custom Hook In More Components
Now we want to use the custom hook we made in the `<NewTask>` component

First we need to import it
```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import useHttp from '../../hooks/use-http.js';

import Section from '../UI/Section';
import TaskForm from './TaskForm';
```

Then we can call it and know that we will receive an object back that we can use destructuring to capture
This time we will name `sendRequest` to be `sendTask` 
Remember we don't need to pass any arguments into `useHttp` 
Instead we will pass arguments into `sendTask`
```js
const NewTask = (props) => {

  const { isLoading, error, sendRequest: sendTask } = useHttp();
  ...
```

Now we can get rid of the two states and the `useState` import

We want this POST request to trigger when the `enterTaskHandler` is triggered 
Inside of there is where we will call `sendTask`
```js
const NewTask = (props) => {

  const { isLoading, error, sendRequest: sendTask } = useHttp();


  const enterTaskHandler = async (taskText) => {

    sendTask();
    ...
```
Now remember `sendTask` is expecting two arguments
The first one is an object that contains config settings for the request
This includes the url, method, headers, and body
The second one is to forward a method that will process whatever response we get from the api upon submitting this POST request

First we will start with the config object 
It will need the same url we use down below in the code we are about to remove and can use the entire object used as the second argument in the `fetch` method as an outline for the object to pass into `sendTask`
The only major difference is that we won't need to convert the body to json since that is being done in the custom hook 
We can just pass in a plain js object for the body
```js
sendTask({ 
  url: 'https://react-http-82bca-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/tasks.json',
  method: 'POST',
  body: { text: taskText },
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});
```

Now we need to create a function  that does something with the response data
In our old code we are:
1. Receiving the data (already done in custom hook and will passed into function we are writing)
2. Extracting the id
3. Generating an object (`createdTask`)
4. Passing this object into a props method (up to `taskAddHandler` in `<App>` which will cause the task to be displayed in the UI)

We will create this function above `sendTask` for legibility so we don't need to use an anonymous function
We can just copy the old functionality
```js
const NewTask = (props) => {

  const { isLoading, error, sendRequest: sendTask } = useHttp();


  const enterTaskHandler = async (taskText) => {

    const createTask = (taskData) => {
      
      const generatedId = taskData.name; // firebase-specific => "name" contains generated id
      const createdTask = { id: generatedId, text: taskText };
      
      props.onAddTask(createdTask);
    };
    

    sendTask({ 
      url: 'https://react-http-82bca-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/tasks.json',
      method: 'POST',
      body: { text: taskText },
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    });
```

If you did not want `createTask` inside of `enterTaskHandler` (in order to avoid nesting functions) you could place it above `enterTaskHandler` however then `taskText` is not an available variable
We could just say that `createTask` will expect that as another argument but within our custom hook we are only passing one value into this function when we call it
(You can also remove the now unneeded old code in `enterTaskHandler`)
```js
import useHttp from '../../hooks/use-http.js';

import Section from '../UI/Section';
import TaskForm from './TaskForm';

const NewTask = (props) => {

  const { isLoading, error, sendRequest: sendTask } = useHttp();
  
  const createTask = (taskText, taskData) => {
    const generatedId = taskData.name; // firebase-specific => "name" contains generated id
    const createdTask = { id: generatedId, text: taskText };
    props.onAddTask(createdTask);
  };

  const enterTaskHandler = async (taskText) => {
    sendTask(
      { 
        url: 'https://react-http-82bca-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/tasks.json',
        method: 'POST',
        body: { text: taskText },
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
      }, 
      createTask
    );
  };

  return (
    <Section>
      <TaskForm onEnterTask={enterTaskHandler} loading={isLoading} />
      {error && <p>{error}</p>}
    </Section>
  );
};

export default NewTask;

```

So how do we pass in this other parameter when our hook only passes in one?
We can use `.bind` when we call `createTask`
Doing this allows us to set the `.this` keyword but we don't care about that so we can use `null` for the first argument
However the second argument we pass into bind will be bound as the first argument whenever this function is invoked
So we can pass `taskText` in via bind and then when `createTask` is actually called in `useHttp` (as `applyData`) 
It will receive this bound value `taskText` as the first argument and the second argument will be the data that is passed via `applyData(data)`
```js
const enterTaskHandler = async (taskText) => {
  sendTask(
    { 
      url: 'https://react-http-82bca-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/tasks.json',
      method: 'POST',
      body: { text: taskText },
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    }, 
    createTask.bind(null, taskText)
  );
};
```

This is a clever way to include more variables as needed without altering the reusability of our custom hook

Now our app is complete and we are using the same custom hook to make both GET and POST requests
We should be able to see the task list as well as make new tasks
We shouldn't see any errors in the console and in network there shouldn't be an infinite loop of requests being made
