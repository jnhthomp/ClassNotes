## 131. Module Introduction
The last course sections involved more advanced (yet crucial) react concepts such as `useEffect`, `useContext`, and `useReducer`
Before we dive deeper this course section will be to practice what we learned by building a course project
This is a bigger application where all the key things we learned will come together and can be seen in the context of a bigger project
We will see all core react concepts in action

The application we will build is a food order app
At the top is a red header with a website title as well as a button/section to hold a link to the cart along with a number to signify how many items have been added to the cart so far
Then there is a background image overlayed by a small paragraph text section to tell you about the restaurant
Below that is a list of meals with a title, short description, and price
Each meal has a changeable "Amount" number that is initially set to '1' with a "+ Add" button below to add it to the cart
When clicking the cart a modal pops up showing the items that have been added along with the individual price, the number of the item ordered and a total price
To the right of each item in the modal are a set of "+" and "-" buttons that can be used to increase and decrease the amount of each item
On this modal is a "Close" and "Order" button 
The order button will only output to the console for now

This project may be fairly challenging but if you want to try it on your own go ahead
There is a list of css files that are used for styling available on github so you can focus on just getting the react done and understanding those concepts without being distracted by css
