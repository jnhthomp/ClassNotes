## 197. Module Introduction
This section will cover forms and handling user input
This might sound easy but is absolutely vital for a site and can be more difficult than you might think
Especaially if you have to check that data and let the user know if it is invalid or not

We won't learn any new features but will apply features to build good forms

This section will cover:
- What is complex about forms?
- How to handle input values and validation
- Some tools to help simplify forms
