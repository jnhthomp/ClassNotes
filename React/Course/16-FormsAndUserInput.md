## 197. Module Introduction
This section will cover forms and handling user input
This might sound easy but is absolutely vital for a site and can be more difficult than you might think
Especaially if you have to check that data and let the user know if it is invalid or not

We won't learn any new features but will apply features to build good forms

This section will cover:
- What is complex about forms?
- How to handle input values and validation
- Some tools to help simplify forms

## 198. Our Starting Setup
You can find the starting project for this section here: https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/tree/16-working-with-forms/code/01-starting-project

If you install and run this app you will see a simple input box where you can input astring and hit submit

The code itself is very simple with just the most basic form and input being rendered in the `<App>` component

This section will not dive into semantic html and how to use the html for forms OR how to style forms

In this course section we will focus on react and how react deals with forms
