## 226. Module Introduction
Now we will cover a popular 3rd party library called redux
We will cover what it is, why it is important in the react ecosystem, and how we use it in react apps

We will cover:
1. What is Redux and why?
2. Redux basics & Using Redux with React
3. Redux toolkit which simplifies working with redux

## 227. Another Look At State In React Apps
First what is redux?
It is a state management system for cross-component or app-wide state
This means if there is state that needs managed by more than one component redux is there to help
This is the same kind of scenario that we have used context for in the past

We have used state in the past to monitor whether data has changed and allow the app to update
We can kind of split the definition of state to three main kinds of state
1. Local State
  - State that belongs to a single component
    For example listening to user input in an input field; toggleing a show more details field
  - Managed with inside of the component with `useState` or `useReducer`
2. Cross-Component State
  - State that affects multiple components
    For example open/closed state of a modal overlay (may have multiple components to make modal)
  - Can still use `useState` and `useReducer` but must pass their values and methods to update down via props
3. App-Wide State
  - State the affects the entire app (most/all components)
    For example user authentication may make some options or data available/unavailable
  - Can still be used with `useState` and `useReducer` but props must again be used

For cross component and app wide state passing props down can be cumbersome so we have used react context to do this instead
This is a built in feature in react that makes managing cross component and app wide state easier

Redux solves this same problem
Redux and context both accomplish the same thing
