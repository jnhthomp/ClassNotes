## 63. Module Introduction
Now we know how to build components and work with multiple components 
We also know how to work with state and handle multiple events

Now we are going to cover rendering lists and conditional content
We will look at how we will output arrays of data on our page and how we can output different content based on different conditions

We will continue working on the application we had previously started and should finish it this module after adding these features
