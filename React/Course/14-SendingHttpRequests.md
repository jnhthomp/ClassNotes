## 173. Module Introduction
At this point we should have a good understanding of how react works and how to use it
However so far we have only used local data/dummy data

Now we will start working on how we can connect our react application to a backend
Pretty much every application needs to fetch or store data from or to a database

This section covers sending http requests from our application to a backend

This section will cover:
- How do react apps interact with databases?
- Learn how to send http requests and work with responses
- How to handle errors and loading states
