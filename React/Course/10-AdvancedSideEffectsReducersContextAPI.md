## 109. Module Introduction
Now that we have the core basics foundation and it's most important features covered we will taket he next step
We will look at 3 important concepts
- effects 
- reducers
- context

These features are a little more advanced 
This does not mean difficult you just need to know the concepts we have already covered
These features will allow  us to make big steps towards building more complex applications

In this module we will take a closer look at 
- what effects are and how you can work with sideeffects
- How we can manage more complex state within our components with reducers 
- Explore appwide (or at least multiple component wide) state with context (makes sharing state and state updates across components easier)
