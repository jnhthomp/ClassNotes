## 151 Module Introduction
At this point we are able to build basic react apps and have covered many of reacts features
There is still one thing missing that we haven't covered
That is how React works behind the scenes
This may not be interesting but it is important to have an idea how this works
This can ensure you are using it correctly and makes troubleshooting easier

This module will look at:
- How React works behind the scenes
    Not the source code but how it works and updates our components and how that relates to state
- Understanding the Virtual DOM & DOM Updates
- Understanding State & State Updates
